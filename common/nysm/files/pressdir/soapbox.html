<title>SOAP BOX DERBY EXHIBIT OPENS JUNE 8 AT NYS MUSEUM</title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Seventy years after the  debut of Albany&rsquo;s first Soap Box Derby, the New York State  Museum will mark the occasion with the  opening of a small exhibition on the Derby June  8, followed by an awards ceremony at the Museum in conjunction with this year&rsquo;s  Albany competition. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Derby  Doings: The All-American Soap Box Derby,&rdquo; will be open in the Museum lobby  until August 15. The annual Capital District Soap Box Derby competition will be  held in front of the State   Museum on Madison Avenue  on Saturday, June 12th and Sunday, June 13th. The awards ceremony in the Museum&rsquo;s Huxley  Theater will immediately follow Sunday&rsquo;s races at approximately 5 p.m. The  winners in three divisions will advance, all expenses paid, to the World  Championships in Akron, Ohio later in July.</p>
<p> The  exhibition traces the history of the Derby to  the summer of 1933 when Dayton,   Ohio <em>Daily News</em> photographer Myron Scott saw three boys racing down the hill  and proposed what he expected would be a one-time competition. Nineteen  children showed up and Scott was compelled to arrange for another competition  on August 19, 1933. Intensely publicized, the event attracted 362 contestants  and about 40,000 spectators. </p>
<p>The first national championship which  Scott called the All-American Soap Box Derby was launched the following year  with promotional and financial support from newspapers, magazines and  Chevrolet. In 1935, the Derby  relocated to Akron, Ohio.</p>
<p>Albany&rsquo;s first competition dates to 1940  when 15,000 people watched 100 boys compete in the first races on Clermont Avenue.  The Derby was locally sponsored and promoted  chiefly by Chevrolet automobile dealers and the Albany <em>Times Union. </em>Ongoing support from both allowed such large events to continue through the  1940s. The Derby  was televised by WRGB in 1949. Racing continued off and on at various locations,  with different sponsors, until it ceased in the 1970s.</p>
<p>However, the Albany Derby was revived  in 2006, managed by Ginger Miller. Boys and girls, ages 8-18, are now invited to participate.The Derby  was also held in Schenectady  at one time. Richard Russell built two cars &ndash; one in 1948 and the other in 1949  -- for the annual races on Fehr    Avenue in Schenectady.  He constructed both of his cars in a building at the Mattice service station  and Mattice Fuel Oil service facility at 1025 Altamont Ave. in Schenectady, a  business dating from the 1920s. It is still operated by the Russell family,  including Richard Russell and his son, Richard Russell Jr., who donated the  Russell car to the State   Museum in 1995.</p>
<p>The 1949 Russell car will be on  display in the exhibition, along with a contemporary Super Stock model built by  Michael Morawski in 2007. He won with it  on Madison Avenue in 2008 and went on to compete in Akron later that summer. Visitors can also see a helmet worn by Russell  at the Schenectady races in 1948 and 1949, a  trophy won by Donald Matthews in the Albany  derby in July 1941, and several photographs that appeared in the <em>Times Union</em> and <em>Daily Gazette</em> in Schenectady. </p>
<p> The New York State Museum  is a program of the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural  Education. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state  natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison  Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Day. </p>
