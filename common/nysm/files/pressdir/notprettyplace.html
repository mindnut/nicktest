<p><strong><u>LANDSCAPE EXHIBIT  OPENS AT NYS MUSEUM SEPTEMBER 3</u></strong></p>
<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; &ldquo;<em>Not Just  Another Pretty Place: The Landscape of New York&rdquo;</em> opens at the New York  State Museum September 3 showcasing the many different ways views of New York have  been captured and used by artists, photographers, scientists and others during  the past 200 years.</p>
<p> This is the  first exhibition of landscape art to be completely culled from the State Museum&rsquo;s  vast collections. On display in the Museum&rsquo;s West Gallery, this exhibition takes  a unique look at the landscape art form, looking beyond the purely aesthetic.  It features more than 100 landscape scenes and includes paintings, photographs,  prints, ceramics, furniture and much more.</p>
<p> The rich and  varied landscape of New York   State has been a subject  of interest to artists, photographers, historians, and scientists alike for  hundreds of years. Artists have used the  landscape in their work to draw tourists to Niagara Falls  or the Adirondacks, create allegorical scenes of the Hudson River for  advertising, and document the ever-changing streets of New York City. </p>
<p> The exhibition includes works by  Currier &amp; Ives, Seneca Ray Stoddard, Jasper Francis Cropsey, Thomas  Benjamin Pope, Fairfield Porter, Edward Gay, Asa Twitchell, E.L. Henry and  William Henry Jackson.</p>
<p>A complementary photo exhibition will  also open on September 3 outside West Gallery in the West Hall Corridor. &ldquo;<em>Wish You Were Here! New   York State  Photographed by You&rdquo; </em>will feature photographs of the scenic New York State landscape submitted by the general  public. These can be photographs of a beloved vacation spot or even the  backyard, neighborhood street or other favorite place. Images chosen for the  exhibition, as well as others that are submitted, will also appear on the  Museum&rsquo;s website and flickr page. Photographs will still be accepted after  September 3, since new ones will continually be added to both the gallery and  website.</p>
<p> Those  wishing to submit photos for &ldquo;<em>Wish You  Were Here&rdquo;</em> will find further information at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/wishyouwerehere">www.nysm.nysed.gov/wishyouwerehere</a>. </p>
