<p>ALBANY,  NY &ndash; A new exhibition opens on June 29 at the New York State Museum  showcasing the works of photographer and conservationist Seneca Ray Stoddard,  who is best known for his photography and  guidebooks of New York&rsquo;s Adirondack   Mountains.<strong><u></u></strong></p>
<p>Seneca Ray Stoddard: Capturing the Adirondacks,  includes over 100 of Stoddard&rsquo;s photographs, Adirondack guideboats and other  items from the Museum&rsquo;s collection that are reflected in the photographs, copies of Stoddard&rsquo;s books and several of his  paintings. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first time the State Museum  has exhibited these remarkably important photographs from our extensive Seneca  Ray Stoddard collection,&rdquo; said Museum Director Mark Schaming. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an  enormously rich visual turn of the century record of the Adirondacks,  as well as other magnificent regions of the state. Stoddard&rsquo;s work continues to be an important  resource in understanding the history and development of the Adirondack region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Born in Wilton,  Saratoga County,  Seneca Ray Stoddard (1844&ndash;1917), focused his photography and writing on the  growing recreational industry of the Adirondacks. His work was instrumental in shaping public  opinion about tourism in the Adirondacks and in the preservation and management  of the Adirondack wilderness.</p>
