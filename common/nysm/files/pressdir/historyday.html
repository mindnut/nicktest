<p>Sixty-one middle and high school students from throughout the Capital Region won top prizes in the Capital Region History Day Contest at the Cultural Education Center in Albany, New York and will advance to the state competition in Cooperstown, New York on April 29.</p>
<p>The preliminary regional competition of the National History Day Contest, held March 23, attracted 132 students and 75 entries from schools in Albany, Clifton Park, Delmar, Guilderland, Granville, Troy, and Schenectady. Participants included students in grades 6-8 in the Junior Division and grades 9-12 in the Senior Division. The national theme for this year&rsquo;s competition is &quot;Turning Points in History.&quot;</p>
<p>After working on their entries for many months, competitors qualified for the preliminary regional contest by doing well at contests held at individual schools throughout the area.  Students researched history topics of their choice related to this year&rsquo;s theme to create exhibits, documentaries, performances, research papers and website designs. Winners of the state competition will advance to the Kenneth E. Behring National History Day Contest June 9-13 at the University of Maryland, College Park.</p>
<p>Each year, more than half a million students, encouraged by thousands of teachers and parents nationwide, participate in the National History Day program. The program makes history come alive for America's youth by engaging them in the discovery of the historic, cultural and social experiences of the past. </p>
