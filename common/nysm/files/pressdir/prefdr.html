<p>ALBANY, N.Y. -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1932 Model 905 Packard will be delivered to the State Museum Saturday, June 19, between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Arnoff Fine Art Services, a division of Arnoff Moving and Storage, Inc., is generously donating their time and resources to move the valuable car Roosevelt purchased himself for use as governor of New York.</p>
<p>The Packard, now in storage at the Museum's Rotterdam facility that houses part of the Museum's collections, will be featured in the upcoming Looking Back: The State Museum in the Year 2000 exhibit scheduled to open on July 15. </p>
