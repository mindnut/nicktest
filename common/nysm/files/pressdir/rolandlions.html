<title>NYS MUSEUM SCIENTIST PARTICIPATES IN NEW NATIONAL STUDY ON LIONS</title>

		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">ALBANY &ndash; A New York State Museum scientist has co-authored an innovative study on zoo animals across America that shows for the first time that cold temperatures help lions grow their manes long and thick &ndash; and more appealing to potential mates. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> Dr. Roland Kays, curator of mammals at the State Museum, was the co-author of the study that appeared on the cover of the April issue of the Journal of Mammology. The study found that up to one-half of the length and density of a zoo lion&rsquo;s mane can be attributed to temperature, rather than nutrition, social factors, individual history or genes. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> Like a buck&rsquo;s antlers or a peacock&rsquo;s tail feathers, the lion&rsquo;s mane primarily servers to attract females and intimidate male competitors. But it comes with a cost. In addition to retaining heat, a full mane takes energy to grow and maintain, gives away location to prey, makes maneuvering through bramble difficult and harbors parasites. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">&ldquo;While a big mane impresses everybody, even a small mane can be imposing in hot dry climates, where the costs of overheating are great and most male lions have little or no mane. This is the case in Tsavo, Kenya where most lions are maneless,&rdquo; said Dr. Bruce D. Patterson, the MacArthur curator of mammals at The Field Museum in Chicago, Ill. And the lead author of the research. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">  Patterson, Kays and other colleagues began studying manes due to their research on the infamous maneless Tsavo lions. Dr. Patterson is the author of The Lions of Tsavo (McGraw Hill, 2004), which tells the story of the man-eaters. At the end of the 19h century, two Tsavo lions set upon railway crews and ate as many as 135 people (by some accounts) before they were finally hunted down and killed. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The new study examined mane variation for 19 lions in 17 zoos across the United States, from as far north as Chicago to as far south as Houston. The zoos included in the study are located in cities that span 12 degrees of latitude or more than 2,000 miles: Alexandria, La.; Coal Valley, Ill.; Dallas; Des Moines, Iowa; Houston; Lufkin, Texas; Memphis, Tenn.; Monroe, La.; New Orleans; Oakland, Calif.; Peoria, Ill.; Sacramento, Calif.; Salina, Kan; St. Louis; Topeka, Kan.; Tyler, Texas; and Vallejo, Calif. </p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Based on the results of this study, scientists now know that lion manes can vary tremendously due to local climate. Therefore, taxonomists may be obliged to reanalyze the lion family tree. Over the years, scientists have ascribed lions to various species and subspecies based largely on their outward appearance, especially the length and density of their manes.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Lions once roamed over most of the world but are now limited to small parts of Africa and India. Only about 25,000 lions live in the wild today, down from more than 100,000 only 25 years ago. Their numbers have been decimated by human encroachment on their habitats and by conflicts with people.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> &quot;The large-maned lion has always been an important symbol to our culture,&quot; said Kays. &quot;We hope they can survive outside of cold-weather zoos.&quot; </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> As the State Museum&rsquo;s curator of mammals, Kays studies the distribution and taxonomy of carnivores in Albany&rsquo;s Pine Bush and the Adirondacks. Kays also has done other research on the Tsavo lions in Kenya as part of a team supported by the National Geographic Society and Earthwatch. An Albany resident, Kays received his undergraduate degree in biology at Cornell University before earning his doctorate in zoology at the University of Tennessee. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> The New York State Museum is a program of the New York State Department of Education, the University of the State of New York and the Office of Cultural Education. Started in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research and collection survey in the United States. The State Museum is located on Madison Avenue in Albany. It is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information about programs and events can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at www.nysm.nysed.gov.</p>
