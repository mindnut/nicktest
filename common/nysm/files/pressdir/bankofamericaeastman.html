<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, N.Y.  &ndash; <em>Seeing Ourselves: Masterpieces of  American Photography from George Eastman House Collection</em> opens February 12  at the New York State Museum  as the next exhibition in the Bank of America Great Art Series.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> On  view through May 9 in the Museum&rsquo;s West Gallery, the exhibition is the 22nd  installment of the Bank of America Great Art Exhibition and Education Program,  which brings art from New York State&rsquo;s leading art museums and collections to the State Museum. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <em>Seeing Ourselves </em>introduces  American audiences to historical and contemporary photographic masterpieces. Proving  the power of photography, more than 155 images and artifacts tell the story of America over  the last 150 years. Through this specialized photography collection of faces,  places, events and actions, many visitors will see themselves. The  photographers range from professionals such as Lewis W. Hine, Dorothea Lange,  Matthew Brady and many others, to several who are unidentified. The images  capture America  and Americans in various ages and stages. They depict grandeur and simplicity,  joy and anger, beauty and grit. A  limited number of brochures on the exhibition will be available at the gallery  entrance, made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  exhibition is drawn entirely from the collection of George Eastman House. It is  arranged into five sections: &ldquo;American Masterpieces,&rdquo; &ldquo;American Faces,&rdquo; &ldquo;America at War,&rdquo; &ldquo;America the Beautiful&rdquo; and &ldquo;American  Families.&rdquo; Each section addresses key photographic works documenting the  American cultural experience. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> The &ldquo;American Masterpieces&rdquo; section displays photographs  that show outstanding artistry, skill or workmanship. They show  that American masterpieces cover a broad spectrum of subject, format, and  history. Some photographs began as intentional works of art while others began  as something else &ndash; propaganda, information, <em>aide memoire</em>, or novelty &mdash; and only later achieved iconic status.  This section will include &ldquo;The Steerage&rdquo; by Alfred Stieglitz, &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; by  Edward Weston, and &ldquo;Yosemite Valley, Summer&rdquo;  by Ansel Adams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the &ldquo;American Faces&rdquo; section  visitors will see photographs of people that have been used to create celebrity, establish identity,  and influence our perceptions. Photographers who have captured these American  faces include Mathew Brady, Richard Avedon, Alfred Stieglitz, Dorothea Lange,  Edward Steichen, Mary Ellen Mark, and Gordon Parks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &ldquo;America at War&rdquo; section reminds  visitors that of all the information that photography brings us, little is more  pressing than news about war. Since the beginning of photography, images have  defined our understanding of conflict. Images will include &ldquo;A Harvest of Death,  Gettysburg&rdquo; by Timothy O&rsquo;Sullivan; David Douglas  Duncan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Combat, Korea&rdquo;;  &ldquo;Reaching Out, The DMZ&rdquo; by Larry Burrows; and &ldquo;Vietnam Memorial, Washington, DC&rdquo;  by Hiroshi Watanabe. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Timeless photographs that exemplify  the beauty and power of nature and an expanding America  are included in the &ldquo;America  the Beautiful&rdquo; section. On display will be William Henry Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mt Sopris,  from Junction of Rock Creek,&rdquo; &ldquo;Refugio  Beach&rdquo; by Ansel Adams, &ldquo;Dunes&rdquo; by  Edward Weston and &ldquo;Desertscape, Death Valley&rdquo;  by Marilyn Bridges. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &ldquo;American  Families&rdquo; section explores the role photography can play in helping to put our  own family experience into context and define &ldquo;family&rdquo; for ourselves. Included  are &ldquo;Tenement Penthouse&rdquo; by Weegee, &ldquo;Italian Family, Ellis Island&rdquo; by Lewis  Hine, &ldquo;East Harlem&rdquo; by Helen Levitt and &ldquo;The  Damm Family in Their Car&rdquo; by Mary Ellen Mark.</p>
<p>  Forty-minute Interpretive Tours of <em>Seeing Ourselves</em>, and an open discussion focusing on several  photographs, will be held at 1 and 2 p.m. on February 13-14, 27-28, March  20-21, April 24-25 and May. 8-9.</p>
