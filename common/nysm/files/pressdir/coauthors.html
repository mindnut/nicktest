<title>STATE MUSEUM RESEARCHERS CO-AUTHOR STUDY ON COYOTES</title>

<p>ALBANY, NY (September 23, 2009) &ndash; Two New York State Museum  scientists have co-authored a new study  published today in a major scientific journal that explains how coyotes evolved  to be larger and stronger over the past 90 years, dramatically expanding their  geographic range and becoming the top predator in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Dr. Roland Kays, the museum&rsquo;s curator  of mammals, and Dr. Jeremy Kirchman, curator of birds, co-authored an article  on their research that was published in <em>Biology  Letters</em>, a peer-reviewed journal that publishes high-quality biology research  . The other author was Abigail Curtis,  who did this work as a SUNY Albany undergraduate, but is now a graduate student  at the University of California in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The article  notes that the North American coyote evolved as a hunter of small prey in the  Great Plains, but rapidly colonized all of eastern North   America over the last half-century. Previous research suggested  that the spread of agriculture and the extinction of wolves may have helped  coyote expansion, but genetic interchange with remnant wolf populations had  never been thoroughly addressed. </p>
<p>This  new study of eastern coyote genetics and skull morphology shows that remnant  wolf populations in Canada  hybridized with coyotes expanding north of the Great Lakes,  thereby contributing to the evolution of coyotes from mousers of western  grasslands to deer hunters of eastern forests. The resulting coy-wolf hybrids  are larger, with wider skulls that are better adapted for hunting deer. Historical records of the coyote  population expansion indicated that movement along the northern route was five  times faster than along the route south of the Great Lakes.  Populations of pure western coyote and  coy-wolf hybrids are presently coming into contact in areas of western New York and Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>The  scientists based their study on DNA sequence data from 696 eastern coyotes and measurements  of 196 skulls from State   Museum specimens. They  also tested three very large animals that looked  more like large, full-blooded grey wolves. Two of the  animals had the western grey wolf genetic signature and one had a Great Lakes  wolf signature, suggesting that a few full-sized wolves have recently migrated  into New York and Vermont, but are not breeding here<strong>.</strong> Only one of the 696 coyote samples  was closely related to domestic dogs, showing that coyotes are not frequently  breeding with domestic dogs in the region and the popular moniker &lsquo;coydog&rsquo; is  technically inaccurate. </p>
<p>In the past, Kays has studied coyote diet and distribution in Albany&rsquo;s  Pine Bush and the Adirondacks. The research indicated that deer accounted  for approximately one-third of the coyote&rsquo;s diet and that they made extensive  use of forested areas. </p>
<p>An Albany resident, Kays received his  undergraduate degree in biology at Cornell  University before earning his  doctorate in zoology at the University   of Tennessee. </p>
<p>Kirchman,  also of Albany,  uses DNA sequencing technology to examine genetic differences among populations  and species. Most of his work has focused on populations of birds that are  isolated on islands, and recently he has focused on habitat islands on mountain  tops, including the Catskills and Adirondacks. </p>
<p>He  has an undergraduate degree in biology from Illinois  Wesleyan University,  a master&rsquo;s degree from Louisiana State University,  and a doctorate degree in zoology from the University of Florida. </p>
<p> The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Started  in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural  history research and collection survey in the United States. Located on  Madison Avenue in Albany,  it is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and  New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information about programs and  events can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website  at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
