<title>STATE MUSEUM PALEONTOLOGIST RECEIVES HIGH HONOR</title>

<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; New York State Paleontologist Dr. Ed Landing has been  elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences  (AAAS), a high honor bestowed upon a select group of geologists nationwide.</p>
<p> Fellows  are recognized by their peers for meritorious efforts to advance science or its  applications. Landing is one of only 10 fellows selected from the Geological  Sciences. All of those elected will be recognized for their contributions to  science and technology at the Fellows Forum during the annual AAAS meeting in Chicago on February 14.</p>
<p> This  award follows another major award Landing received last May when he became the  first U.S.  citizen and first paleontologist to win the R.J.W. Douglas Medal. The medal is bestowed annually by the  Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists to recognize scholars who make  outstanding contributions to the understanding of the sedimentary geology of Canada. </p>
<p>In awarding the medal, the  organization cited Landing&rsquo;s work tracking the evolution of Earth&rsquo;s oldest<strong> </strong>animals, particularly his data on  their origins in eastern Newfoundland.  The research led to definition of a time standard known as the Precambrian-  Cambrian boundary, which has provided scientists with far more accurate  chronology than they once had. Landing also has used evidence supplied by the  rocks in New York and Canada to propose the likely  production of major gas and oil deposits when ancient seas were very high.</p>
<p>  The state paleontologist and curator of  paleontology at the State   Museum since 1981,  Landing </p>
<p>has authored six books, 13 New York State   Museum bulletins and has  received more than a dozen competitive grants. Forty-seven of his 115  peer-reviewed papers are based on his field work in Canada and he has conducted field  studies in all but three provinces and territories. That work has helped  provide a more complete understanding of early life in New York.</p>
<p> Landing also  has been honored by the New York State Assembly and was cited by the U.S. Paleontological Society for having the &ldquo;1989 Best Paper&rdquo; for  work published on the origin of animals in the <em>Journal of Paleontology</em> and &ldquo;1979 Best Paper&rdquo; from the American  Association of Petroleum Geologists for research on oolitic limestones  published in the <em>Journal of Sedimentary  Petrology.</em></p>
<p>He has devoted five National Science  Foundation grants, totaling about $1.5 million, to tracing the evolutionary  origins of modern marine groups worldwide. He co-authored a paper published in  the journal <em>Nature</em> about the Museum&rsquo;s  discovery of the Earth&rsquo;s oldest tree fossil in the Catskill   Mountains, providing an important glimpse of what the forests  looked like 380 million years ago. </p>
<p>Landing also has worked on several  Museum exhibitions including <em>Ancient Life  of New York</em>, and worked to restore two Museum parks in Saratoga County  &ndash; Lester Park and Stark&rsquo;s Knob. He also has participated in numerous museum  programs and events including annual lecture series, field trips and the </p>
<p>&ldquo;James Campbell Memorial Gem,  Mineral and Fossil Show and Sale.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Landing became interested in Early  Paleozoic rocks and fossils as an undergraduate at the University of  Wisconsin-Madison. He earned his masters and Ph.D. at the University  of Michigan, devoting his doctoral  thesis to Early Paleozoic Biostratigraphy based on field work along the St.  Lawrence River, in southern New Brunswick and  parts of western Newfoundland.  He has conducted post-doctoral studies at the University  of Waterloo, with the United States  Geological Survey in Denver and at the University of Toronto. </p>
<p>The New York State Museum  is a cultural program of the New York State Education Department. Founded in  1836, the museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history  research and collection survey in the U.S. The State  Museum is located on Madison Avenue in  Albany. It is  open daily from 9:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New  Year&rsquo;s Day. Further information can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or  visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
