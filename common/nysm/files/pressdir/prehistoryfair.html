<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - Clean out your attic to help clean out Historic Cherry Hill's attic. The New York State Museum and other area historical sites and groups are joining forces on <strong>Sunday, April 30 from noon to 5 p.m. </strong>for the first Albany History Fair to help raise money for a new storage and research facility for the 213-year-old house. The event will be held in the State Museum's Terrace Gallery, and Albany Mayor Gerald Jennings is serving as the honorary chairman.</p>
<p>Curators will help identify those family heirlooms and flea market finds you're curious about, while professional appraisers will be available to place a monetary value on the objects. Conservators will also be on hand to assess the condition of objects and make recommendations regarding their care. Each piece that is reviewed costs $5. Admission to the fair is free.</p>
<p>"We really want to emphasize the historical significance to your family," said Liselle LaFrance, the director of Historic Cherry Hill. The event was also developed to raise awareness of Cherry Hill and its needs, and to bring local historical groups together.</p>
<p>The funds raised will help build the Edward Frisbee Center for Collections and Research on the Cherry Hill property on Pearl Street. Currently, collections not being displayed in the living spaces of Cherry Hill are stored in the house's attic, which is causing structural damage to the building. Cherry Hill's 20,000 objects are the culmination of five generations of one family from 1787-1963. Built for Philip and Maria Van Rensselaer, the house and its contents were bequeathed by the last surviving family member, Emily Rankin, to benefit the people of New York State.</p>
<p>Along with artifact identification, there will be presentations and events throughout the day, including tours of <em>Treasures from the Wunsch Americana Foundation.</em> State Museum Curators John Scherer and Ron Burch will lead tours of the exhibition of New York furniture, silver, paintings, ceramics and glass.</p>
<p>Other events include:</p>
