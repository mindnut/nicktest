<p>ALBANY, N.Y. -- Hundreds of schoolchildren are learning how to interpret fine art at the New York State Museum through the Fleet Great Art Exhibition and Education Program.</p>
<p>Students from schools throughout the area are visiting the State Museum to learn about Pop Art: Selections from the Museum of Modern Art, the first Fleet Great Art exhibit running through May 2.</p>
<p>"As part of the State Education Department, we are deeply committed to making the Fleet Great Art Series a memorable learning experience for students, as well as adults," Museum Director Cliff Siegfried said.</p>
<p>Education programs for students are developed in collaboration with the Capital Region Center for Arts in Education. The programs are ongoing from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays for the visiting students. On weekends through April 25 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., an artist is available to answer questions for the general public.</p>
 <p>Schools participating in the Pop Art outreach programs include: Fort Edward Elementary School, Livingston Magnet School in Albany and the Oliver Winch Junior High School in South Glens Falls.</p>
<p>Teaching artist Tom Gagnon, an abstract painter, first worked with many of the students in their classrooms showing them slides and preparing them for the Museum experience.</p>
<p>As Gagnon takes them on a tour of the exhibit, he engages them with questions about what they see in the works, what they consider to be their favorite paintings or their least favorite.</p>
<p>Then to make the conceptual leap, students construct their own Pop Art to gain a better understanding of what artists like Andy Warhol, Robert Indiana and Claes Oldenburg were trying to express.</p>
<p>The students' Pop Art pieces may be displayed on a board outside the Pop Art exhibit to show how they used some of the same techniques used by those artists involved in the Pop Art movement. </p>
 <p>Some of the exhibit's highlights include Warhol's famous series of thirty-two Campbell's Soup Cans, 1962, and Self-Portrait, 1966; Tom Wesselmann's well-known Still Life #30; and Oldenburg's Giant Soft Fan, 1966-67.</p>
<p>Curated by Anne Umland, Pop Art features 26 works from MoMA's renowned collection - all created in the U.S. during the 1960s - the defining decade of this movement.</p>
<p>The series is funded through a $450,000 grant from Fleet to be used over the next three years to bring exceptional shows to the State Museum. An additional $100,000 challenge grant from The Hearst Foundation, Inc. will help the Museum further strengthen the program.</p>
<p>The series was made possible with the leadership of state Sen. Roy M. Goodman, R-Manhattan, who initiated these exhibits by encouraging the partnership between the State Museum and the great art museums of New York City.</p>
<p>Along with Goodman, Harry M. Rosenfeld, editor-at-large of the Times Union of Albany, was instrumental in assisting the State Museum.</p>
