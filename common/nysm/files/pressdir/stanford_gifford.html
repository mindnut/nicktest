<p style="text-align:justify;">An exhibition featuring the  art of Civil War soldier and renowned Hudson River School painter Sanford  Robinson Gifford will open at the New York State Museum on November 9, 2013. <em>Sanford Gifford's Civil War </em>is presented  in conjunction with An Irrepressible  Conflict: The Empire State in the Civil War, a 7,000-square foot exhibition commemorating the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Civil War. Both exhibits are open through March 23, 2014. &nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Sanford Gifford's Civil  War </em>features three of Gifford's paintings from the New York State Military  Museum's collection in Saratoga Springs, as well as artifacts and images from  the New York State Museum and New York State Library. The Board of Regents and  the State Museum are committed to partnering with cultural institutions  throughout the state to bring cultural treasures to Albany. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&quot;We are pleased to host a  selection of Gifford's paintings from the New York State Military Museum here  at the State Museum,&quot; said State Museum Director Mark Schaming. &quot;The Civil War  impacted all New Yorkers and Sanford Gifford, a New York native, soldier, and  important American artist associated with the Hudson River School, provides a distinctive  look at the impact of the War through these important paintings.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">New York State played a pivotal role in the Civil War.&nbsp; Its citizens included abolitionist  leaders, such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, and Sojourner  Truth; prominent politicians, such as William Seward and Horace Greeley; and  prominent generals who helped with the war on the battlefield, such as Philip  Sheridan and Gouverneur K. Warren. One of the lesser known wartime  contributions made by the people of New York include the masterful works of art  created at the time by important artists who lived in New York and fought in  the war such as Sanford Gifford.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Sanford Gifford's Civil  War</em> is part of continued programming by the New York State Museum, State  Library, and State Archives to complement <em>An  Irrepressible Conflict</em> including lectures, guided tours for students, and  educational activities for children and families. Additional support for the  Civil War exhibition is provided by RBC Wealth Management.</p>
