<p>ALBANY,  N.Y. &ndash; As part of the &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Move&rdquo; initiative led by First Lady Michelle Obama,  the New York State Museum is offering &ldquo;Smart &rsquo;N Healthy: Museum Movers and  Shakers,&rdquo; a six-week activity and health program for children.</p>
<p>Designed  for children, ages 7-11, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Move! Museums and Gardens&rdquo; was launched by Mrs.  Obama and the Institute   of Museum and Library  Services (IMLS) to combat the increase in childhood obesity. Museums and  gardens across the nation are asked by the First Lady to create interactive  exhibitions and programs that promote physical activity and inform visitors  about healthy food choices. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart  &rsquo;N Healthy&rdquo; is a free program that will run from Oct. 1 through Nov. 12 on  Saturday mornings at the State Museum from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Parents may participate  in any or all of the sessions but are especially encouraged to attend the  special cooking classes led by Sandra Varno of the Cornell Cooperative  Extension on Oct. 29 and Nov. 5. Also, Chef Yono Purnomo of Yono&rsquo;s restaurant  in Albany will  teach participants how to make a quick and healthy snack on Oct. 1. Registration  for the &ldquo;Smart&rsquo;N Healthy&rdquo; program is necessary and closes Sept. 26. To register  call Peggy Steinbach at 518/474-1569 or email her at psteinba@mail.nysed.gov.</p>
<p> All activities will begin at the State Museum.  They include a walk to the Port of Albany to see a Coast Guard cutter on Oct. 8; lessons  on the &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Move&rdquo; dance, taught by an eba Center  for Dance instructor, on Oct. 22; ZUMBA for Kids on Oct. 29 and a walk to the  grocery store on Nov. 5 to buy groceries before preparing a meal. The &ldquo;Smart &rsquo;N  Healthy&rdquo; program will conclude with an award ceremony and farewell party, with  prizes for participants, on Nov. 12.</p>
<p> The Museum program was developed by  The Links, Inc., an international organization of predominately  African-American professional women, who identified childhood obesity as a  problem in the African-American community in 2006. Using a grant from the  Kellogg Foundation, the Links </p>
<p>partnered  with the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta  to research the impact of childhood obesity in the  African-American community and develop a sound educational program that could  be used as a tool to  combat the growing epidemic. </p>
<p>Founded in 1836, the State Museum  is a cultural program of the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of  Cultural Education. Located  on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on  Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
