<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - Shaker experts from the New York State Museum and other local museums and historic sites will gather at the State Museum on <strong>October 21, from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m.</strong>, to explore the influences that shaped and created the Shaker legacy.</p>
<p>The New York State Museum has played a special role in preserving the heritage of the Shakers. In 1926, with their numbers dwindling, the Shakers embarked on a fifteen year partnership with the museum in an effort to insure that their culture would survive. As a result, the museum possesses a collection of Shaker artifacts unique in the world. For the first time since 1982, portions of that collection are now on display - including the only intact Fountain Stone, used for religious rituals, that survives from any Shaker community. A Shaker Legacy: The Shaker Collection at the New York State Museum is on view in the museum's Exhibition Hall through <strong>Sunday, Oct. 22.</strong></p>
<p>In association with the museum's exhibit of Shaker artifacts, the symposium will explore the history surrounding the creation of the Shaker legacy by various museums and collectors. The symposium's speakers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Scherer, Associate Curator at the State Museum, speaking on the creation of the State Museum's Shaker Collection.</li>
<li>Jerry Grant, from the Shaker Museum at Old Chatham, doing a presentation on the Shaker Collection at the Shaker Museum at Old Chatham.</li>
<li>Sharon Koomler, Curator at Hancock Shaker Village, talking about Shaker spirit drawings and the establishment of Hancock Shaker Village Museum.</li>
<li>Shaker authority Elizabeth Shaver and Craig Williams, Associate Curator, New York State Museum, presenting a program on William F. Winter, photographer of the Shakers.</li>
<li>Ned Pratt, former Director of Shaker Heritage Society and President of the local chapter of the Society of Architectural Historians, doing a program on Shaker Barns.</li>
<li>Fran Kramer, author and Shaker Collector, speaking on Shaker Collecting in the Twentieth Century.</li>
</ul>
<p>The symposium will include a catered luncheon at 12 Noon and a gallery tour commencing at 4 o'clock. There is a fee of $46, $40 for Museum members. Pre-registration is required by October 6. The public may call (518) 473-7154 for information.</p>
