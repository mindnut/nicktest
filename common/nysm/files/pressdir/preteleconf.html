<p>ALBANY, NY -- Soon students around the state will be able to tap into the vast resources of the New York State Museum without even leaving their classrooms. Today, the State Museum participated in a teleconference broadcast on Capitol Hill advising U.S. senators on advancing technology in education.</p>
<p>As millions of children head back to school, <em>Education Technology -- the Public-Private Partnership</em> gave museums and other institutions a chance to showcase what's available to students through special technology programs.</p>
<p>In the next year, the New York State Museum will produce teleconference programs for students across the state. One program will teach fourth and seventh graders about the Iroquois Long House, one of the life-size exhibits the Museum features, according to Pat Jordan, the Museum's Acting Chief of Educational and Public Programs, who will speak to the senators. </p>
<p>&quot;The objective is to instruct students on the cultural history of the Iroquois people of New York state,&quot; Jordan said. Students will be able to view how the Iroquois lived without leaving their classrooms. </p>
<p>The State Museum is also in the process of installing a &quot;Multi-Mimsy&quot; collections management system, which will eventually allow students throughout the state to visit the museum's collections from a computer in the school library. </p>
<p>Eventually, the State Museum plans links with other museums and institutions that will give students the opportunity to view collections and participate in programs from around the world.</p>
<p>Other institutions participating in Wednesday's event include: the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Museum of Photography Film &amp; Television in the United Kingdom, The Museum of Television and Radio from New York City and the Smithsonian.</p>
