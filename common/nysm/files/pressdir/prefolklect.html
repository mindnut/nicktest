<p>Elizabeth Stillinger, a noted historian in the fields of American decorative arts, will talk about the history of collecting folk art. The earliest American folk art collectors were interested in objects considered to be of little value, such as redware pottery, fraktur paintings, decoys and portraits. Yet these collectors were at the forefront of a wave of fascination in American folk art that continues to this day. Among those considered in this lecture are Henry Mercer, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, and Edgar and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch. Stillinger is the author of a forthcoming book titled Collecting Folk Art in America 1876-1976.</p>

<em>2 p.m., Sunday, March 26</em></p>
<p>Paul D'Ambrosio, Chief Curator at the New York State Historical Association, will trace the development of folk art in New York from the 17th century to the present. New York has always been a cultural crossroads, with a multitude of people from different backgrounds continuously contributing to the artistic heritage of the state. D'Ambrosio recently curated the exhibition <em>Empire State Mosaic: The Folk Art of New York</em> at the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown.</p>
