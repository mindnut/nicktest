<title>CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS INDUSTRY HAS MAJOR IMPACT ON STATE ECONOMY</title>

<p>ALBANY  -- The construction materials industry in New York State, which accounts for  most of the state&rsquo;s mining of natural resources, generates $5 billion annually, far outpacing  other manufacturing industries, according to a new report on the industry&rsquo;s  economic impact.</p>
<p> Working with the Center for  Governmental Research in Rochester,  State Geologist Dr. William Kelly, director of the New York State Geological  Survey, recently completed a study on the construction industry&rsquo;s contribution  to the state economy.</p>
<p> Most of the  mining in New York   State is for construction  purposes, involving cement, crushed stone, and sand and gravel. Excluding fuel resources, last year each New  Yorker used over 20,000 pounds of minerals to maintain his/her standard of  living. Per person, this accounted for more than 18,000 pounds of cement and  construction aggregates in roads, bridges, homes, schools, highway repair,  parking lots and a host of other projects that require concrete, black top, or  stone fill.</p>
<p> Included in  the study were the mining industry and the ready mix concrete and hot mix  asphalt industries, which consume most of the output of New York&rsquo;s mines. The economic impact encompassed both the  direct expenditures of the industry -- wages paid to miners -- and also the  value of the indirect impact of the business.  The indirect impact addressed the dollars subsequently spent by those  who receive direct expenditures.</p>
<p> The  study revealed that the activities of the construction materials industry  generate $1.3 billion in labor income for 30,000 jobs in New York, $100 million in taxes on income,  sales, fuels and corporations, and roughly $3.5 billion in sales. This accounts for more salary and jobs than what  is generated by the state&rsquo;s warehouse and storage industry. It is twice the salary and employment of the  primary metal manufacturing industry, and four times that of New York&rsquo;s wood product manufacturing sector.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The  current economic impact of the construction materials industry also greatly  exceeds to potential economic benefits of the very intensely promoted Marcellus  gas play in central New York. The Independent  Oil and Gas Association of New York estimates that the economic impact of  natural-gas wells drilled in the Marcellus Shale would generate $1.4 billion in  economic activity, $32 million in state tax revenue, and hundreds of jobs.</p>
<p> Mines  are not always welcomed into communities in New York but the products of those  operations are essential to modern life.  The study looked at what the cost would be for transporting aggregates for  projects on the New York State Thruway as an example of what would happen if New York did not have a  viable mining industry. The mines that serve the Thruway with building  materials were located and one-quarter and one-half of them were randomly  eliminated as sources of stone. The cost  of transporting aggregates for Thruway projects was then recalculated. </p>
<p>Results indicate that if a quarter of  mines along the Thruway corridor were not in operation, transportation costs  would increase 42 percent. If half of  the mines were not available to supply resources, costs would increase roughly  60 percent. This obviously would impact  total project costs and, ultimately, the scope of the project. This analysis can be applied to any  construction project in New York  that makes use of stone, asphalt or concrete. </p>
<p>The New York State  Geological Survey (NYSGS)is the geological research arm of the State Museum. <u> </u></p>
<p> The New York State   Museum is a cultural  program of the New York State Department of Education&rsquo;s Office of Cultural  Education. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating  state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located  on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be  obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
