<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Museum has scheduled two additional presentations of a documentary first shown in February that explores both sides of the evolution vs. intelligent design controversy.<br />
 &ldquo;Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus&rdquo; will be presented on Saturday, March 10 and 24th at 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. in the Clark Auditorium.<br />
In the feature-length (85 minutes) documentary, filmmaker and evolutionary biologist Dr. Randy Olson pokes fun at both sides of the ongoing argument between &ldquo;condescending scientists and extremist intelligent designers.&rsquo;&rsquo; At the same time, the film delves head first into the seriousness of the issue that is at the heart of the current political division.<br />
Olson received his doctorate from Harvard University and went on to build a career as a marine biologist/evolutionary ecologist until the mid 90&rsquo;s when he decided to pursue a career as a Hollywood director at the University of Southern California&rsquo;s Graduate School of Cinema/Television. &ldquo;You Ruined My Career,&rdquo; a comedy/musical he directed, won multiple awards including one at the Telluride Film Festival. Additional information on the filmmaker and film can be found at www.flockofdodos.com.<br />
