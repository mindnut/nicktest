<p>ALBANY &ndash; This year&rsquo;s Hudson-Fulton-Champlain  Quadricentennial celebration provided inspiration for the New    York State Museum&rsquo;s 8th annual &ldquo;Haunted  Museum of Unnatural History &ndash; the 1609 Quadricenterror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  The &ldquo;Haunted   Museum&rdquo; will be open  October 24 and 25 from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., October 30 from 6 to 10 p.m. and on Halloween, October 31 from 11 a.m. to 4  p.m. and 6 to 10 p.m. It will be located in the Student Center  on the Museum&rsquo;s first floor. </p>
<p> The &ldquo;Monster Mash &amp; Bash&rdquo; will  provide light-hearted fun for younger children, aged 10 and under. It will  be held on the Museum&rsquo;s fourth floor Terrace Gallery on October 24, 25 and 31,  from noon to 4 p.m. Children  and their families are invited to dress for a 1 p.m. costume parade, which will  end at the Carousel. The&ldquo;Monster  Mash &amp; Bash&rdquo; will feature Halloween crafts. The Smile Monster will make an  appearance on Sunday, October  25 and Saturday, October 31.</p>
<p>  Visitors to the &ldquo;Haunted Museum&rdquo;  will first enter a pirate ship, the &ldquo;Hell Moon,&rdquo; where they will see crew  members representing those on Henry Hudson&rsquo;s Halfmoon. They then will step  aboard a dock that curves around in the &ldquo;Port of Terror&rdquo;  where they will be surrounded by &ldquo;water&rdquo; and sounds of the ocean. Stepping back  on land, visitors will enter into the dark &ldquo;Alleyway,&rdquo; a lawless area where  beggars and thieves roam free in old New Netherland.  Next will be the &ldquo;Tenement,&rdquo; a dingy, overcrowded room of tight quarters where society&rsquo;s  most unfortunate rest wherever they can. The hopelessness and despair led some  of the poor to the next area -- the &ldquo;Asylum,&rdquo; which includes an area where  lobotomies are performed. From there, visitors will enter the mouth and then  into the mind of one of the patients. The final encounter will be the gravesite  where Henry Hudson may make an appearance. </p>
<p> Visitors  are advised that the intense lighting, sounds and special effects are not for  everyone and definitely not suitable for children under 10. Anyone under 12 must be accompanied by an  adult. &ldquo;Haunted Museum&rdquo; visitors are asked not to wear costumes, but costumes  are encouraged for the &ldquo;Monster Mash &amp; Bash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Proceeds from both events will benefit the Museum&rsquo;s after-school  programs for Albany  city youth. Admission to the &ldquo;Haunted Museum&rdquo; is $8. Monster Mash admission is  $2. The Halloween events are a significant source of funding for the  Museum&rsquo;s youth programs, making it possible for many children to attend educational after-school  programs tuition-free or at reduced cost. Youths involved in the Discovery  Squad teen program and the Time  Tunnel summer camp, are taking an active role in planning and building the &ldquo;Haunted Museum.&rdquo;</p>
