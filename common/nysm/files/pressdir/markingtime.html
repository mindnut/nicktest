<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; The personal thoughts and feelings of American  soldiers and Marines going to war in Southeast Asia come to life in the  &ldquo;Marking Time: Voyage to Vietnam&rdquo;  exhibition opening Nov. 11 (Veterans Day) at the New York State   Museum.</p>
<p>The stories of these soldiers and  Marines are told through the graffiti they left behind on the bunk canvases  they slept on, aboard a ship that brought them to Vietnam in 1966-67. Eight canvases  inscribed by soldiers from New York  state are included in the traveling exhibition, open until Feb. 26, 2012.  Uncertain about their future, the young troop passengers inscribed personal  thoughts about families, hometowns, patriotism, love, anxiety, discomfort and  humor. </p>
<p>Their canvases, bunks and personal  items were discovered in 1997 onboard the General Nelson M. Walker. The  transport ship was being scrapped after seeing service during World War II and the  Korean and Vietnam  wars. In between it was in reserve status in a Hudson River berthing area, near  New York City, for  six years. Military historian Art Beltrone discovered the historic graffiti and  other artifacts during a trip to Virginia&rsquo;s James  River Reserve Fleet, where the ship had been relocated from New York.</p>
<p>When discovered, the Walker was a veritable  floating time capsule, filled with hundreds of historical artifacts relating to  the Vietnam War, the 1960s, and the men who went to war. Many of those  artifacts will be on display. Included is an original eight-man rack of  sleeping bunks, complete with the original mattresses, sheets, pillows,  blankets and life vests. The rack shows how confining living space was during  the uncomfortable 18-23 day, over 5,000-mile voyage to Vietnam. There also is clothing, shoes, comic books,  magazines and copies of <em>The Walker Report</em>,  the ship&rsquo;s official newspaper written, printed and distributed by troop  passengers. Other personal objects left behind, such as playing cards, empty  cigarette and candy wrappers, liquor bottles, religious tracts and rosary  beads, were found hidden under the sheets. </p>
<p>The multi-dimensional exhibition also  includes two short films, &ldquo;<em>Marking Time:  Voyage to Vietnam&rdquo; </em>and &ldquo;<em>Discovery of a Forgotten  Troopship,&rdquo;</em> which can also be viewed at <a href="http://www.vietnamgraffiti.com/museums-media-info">http://www.vietnamgraffiti.com/museums-media-info</a>.  </p>
<p>The exhibition is curated by Beltrone  and his wife, Lee of Keswick, Va. Together they founded the Vietnam Graffiti  Project (VGP) which, assisted by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, is  dedicated to finding the graffiti writers and Walker voyage passengers to tell  and preserve their stories. VGP is still trying to identify many of the  writers, including many of those from New    York state. Among those who have been found are  Harmon Adams of Kenmore, near Buffalo, and Dave  Dubreck of Churchville, near Rochester. </p>
