<p>"The Wreck of the Henry Clay," the worst steamboat disaster to occur on the Hudson River, will be the topic of a lecture on Saturday, Feb. 19th at the New York State Museum.</p>
<p>Speaking at 2 p.m. in the Museum Theater, author Kris A. Hansen of Wallingford, Conn. will tell the story of the extraordinary courage displayed by ordinary people when the Henry Clay burned on the shore of the Hudson River at Riverdale in July 1852. Hansen, a professional reporter and writer, has written a book  --<em>"Death Passage on the Hudson: the Wreck of the Henry Clay"</em> -- about the events that surrounded the catastrophe that took dozens of lives. </p>
<p>Prominent Hudson River families were among the many affected by the disaster, which was reported in the major newspapers of the day and drew national attention. Speculation arose that a race with the competing steamboat <em>Armenia</em> was responsible for the disaster. Negligence was suspected and the public demanded retribution. In her book, Hansen includes witness testimony and information from legal documents to detail the public's search for truth at the official inquest and subsequent legal wrangling in the courts. </p>
<p>Following the Museum lecture, Hansen will sign copies of her book, which will be available for purchase. A native of the Hudson Highlands, Hansen has done writing, reporting and editing for business and special interest publications. </p>
