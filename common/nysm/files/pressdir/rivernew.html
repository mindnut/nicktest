<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; As part of the celebration of the 2009  Hudson-Champlain Quadricentennial celebration, the New York State Office of  Cultural Education (OCE) will present at the New York  State Museum  the exhibition &ldquo;<em>1609,&rdquo; </em>which will re-examine  Henry Hudson&rsquo;s voyage, the myths that surround it, and explore the legacies of Hudson&rsquo;s unexpected discovery.</p>
<p> The  State Museum, State Archives, State Library and State Office of Educational  Broadcasting, which make up OCE, are collaborating on the <em>&ldquo;1609&rdquo;</em> exhibition. It is scheduled to be open July 3, 2009 until March  7, 2010 in the Museum&rsquo;s Exhibition Hall. </p>
<p> The <em>&ldquo;1609&rdquo;</em> exhibition is presented in four parts. The first section focuses  on what life was like for both the Dutch and Native Peoples of New York before  1609 and the events of that year. The visitor will then look at the myths that Hudson planned to come  here, and that Native Americans greeted him and his crew with joy and awe. The  exhibition will attempt to dispel those myths and explore with the visitor what  is known about Hudson  and the 1609 voyage and the Native American response. The third section confronts  the myths relating to the short-term impact of the voyage &ndash; the consequences  for the Dutch and the Native Americans. Finally, the visitor will be able to examine  the long-term legacy of the Native Americans and Dutch, and how they affected  subsequent historical events and American culture  today.</p>
<p>Highlighting  the important role that the Hudson River played in Hudson&rsquo;s discovery and in the everyday lives  of the Native Americans he encountered, visitors entering the gallery will see  the illusion of running water. An outline of the Halve Maen (Half Moon) that  carried Hudson  to the new world, and fast facts about the ship, will be stenciled onto the  gallery floor. The exhibition will also feature many historic drawings, maps  and paintings, including some by Capital District expert historical artist L.F.  Tantillo.</p>
<p>There will be many touchable objects and  a reading area to engage the youngest visitors. Artifacts on display will  include an elaborately decorated c. 1700 &ldquo;Armada Chest&rdquo; or strongbox, a classic  type of chest or portable safe similar to what Henry Hudson most likely had in his quarters  on the Half Moon; a dugout canoe recovered from Glass Lake in Rensselaer County  similar to those used by Native Americans in the 17th century; a bronze  cannon cast for the Dutch West India Company (1604-1661) used at or near Fort  Orange and a stained glass window bearing the Coat of Arms of &ldquo;Jan Baptist van  Renssilaer,&rdquo; patron of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck in the 1650s. A large 1611  etching of the Port of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, courtesy of the  Amsterdam Municipal Archives, also will hang in the gallery.</p>
<p>Many  of the maps and other 17th-century Dutch colonial documents in the exhibition  are from the collections of the New York State Library and the State Archives  and will be located in a separate room where lighting is carefully controlled.  The New Netherland Project, a program of the State Library, has been working  since 1974 to translate and publish these archival records. </p>
<p>Archaeologist  James Bradley, an expert on Native Americans, and Russell Shorto, an authority  on colonial Dutch history, have written text for the exhibition. Bradley is the  author of &ldquo;<em>Before Albany: An Archaeology of Native-Dutch  Relations in the Capital Region 1600-1664</em>,&rdquo; and a guest curator for  portions of the exhibition. Shorto, who resides in the Netherlands, authored <strong>&ldquo;</strong><em>The Island  at the Center of </em></p>
<p><em>the World</em>,&rdquo; the epic story of Dutch Manhattan  and the forgotten colony that shaped America.</p>
<p>Steven  Comer, a Mohican Native American living within the original territory of the  Mohican people, has provided cultural information and consulting for the  project.</p>
<p> The Museum  also is celebrating the Dutch influence on Albany  and New York State  with a trip to Holland and Belgium. This  adventure will allow participants to experience these countries and appreciate  their effect on Albany&rsquo;s  heritage and architecture. The trip is  September 24 through October 1, 2009 and priced at $2,127 per person, double  occupancy. Museum members receive a discount of $50. This trip includes a  week-long stay in a four-star hotel located in the Hague,  Holland&rsquo;s  government capitol. The price includes airfare, transfers, six nights  accommodation, breakfast everyday except arrival, three dinners, private luxury  coach, and local guides in Amsterdam, Bruges, and Delft.
