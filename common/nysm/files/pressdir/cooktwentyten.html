<p>ALBANY, N.Y. &ndash; In  celebration of the 201st anniversary of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s birth, the New York State Museum  will present a series of three cooking demonstrations in February that  highlight the extreme evolution of domestic food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cooking the  Tree of Life &ndash; Food as Extreme Evolution&rdquo; will be presented on three successive  Wednesdays, beginning February 3, at 7 p.m. in the Clark  auditorium. The free program is based on  the premise that the ingredients in our everyday food are extreme examples of  evolution &ndash; ridiculously hot peppers, to super sweet grasses, to flightless  birds. Each demonstration in the weekly series will pair a local chef with a  biologist, and the two will prepare a meal, providing both the culinary and  scientific perspective on the main ingredients. </p>
<p>The February demonstrations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>February 3, Some Like It Hot --       Peppers</strong>: Dr. Roland Kays,       curator of mammals at the State Museum, will lay out the evolutionary       history of peppers, as Food Network Chef David Britton whips up related       dishes in the on-stage kitchen. The       menu will highlight the diversity of peppers, created by humans selecting       for extreme traits, and show why some of the most bizarre evolution has       actually caused the mildest peppers. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>February       10, Some Like It Sweet -- Sugars</strong>:<strong> </strong>Dr. Jason Cryan, an       evolutionary biologist at the State        Museum, will discuss       natural sources of sugars and the ways that humans and animals actively       seek sweets. At the same time Chef Timothy Warnock, corporate chef for       U.S. Foods, will prepare a variety of delectable, sugar-inspired dishes in       the on-stage kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>February       17, Tastes Like Chicken -- Birds: </strong>Dr. Jeremy Kirchman, the State Museum&rsquo;s curator of birds, will team  up with Chef Tony Destratis of the Lake George Club to provide an avian  evolution lesson and to prepare savory dishes featuring flavorful dinosaur  descendants. </li>
</ul>
