<title>NEW YORK STATE MUSEUM TO RECEIVE DONATION FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN COLLECTION</title>

<div id="main"> 
<p>On Friday, May 28th the New York State Museum will receive a donation of artifacts, memorabilia and objects associated with 20th Century African-American culture from the Girl Friends, Incorporated, an international organization of women of African descent who promote educational and civic causes. </p>
<p>Spearheaded by local Girl Friend, Barbara Zuber of Troy, members of the organization will donate and loan to the State Museum objects and ephemera that once belonged to James Weldon Johnson, John Rosamond Johnson, Ethel Waters, Elmer Campbell and others who have made significant contributions to the history and development of New York culture and were associated with members of Girl Friends, Incorporated. </p>
<p>In addition to Mrs. Zuber, Melanie Edwards and Karen Day Selsey of New York City will also make donations or loans to the Museum. The presentation will be at 5:30 p.m. in the Museum Theater at the State Museum and will be part of the Girl Friends' national conference being held in Albany during Memorial Day weekend. </p>
<p>The decision to donate or loan the items was triggered by the loss the Girl Friends experienced when the group's materials were destroyed with the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11th.  Many of the materials lost represented the organization's history, some dating back to the group's founding in New York City in the early 20th century. Their loss made members keenly aware of the importance of preserving the documents and history that represent the growth of African-American culture in this country. </p>
<p>The State Museum has long sought a focus for a collection on African- American culture that would not replicate other collections around the state or the country.  Members of the local Albany Girl Friends' chapter wanted to preserve objects that belonged to noted African-Americans who took part in 
significant social movements in New York State, beginning with the Harlem Renaissance.  The donations from the Girl Friends are the beginning of what will someday be a significant Museum collection on 20th century African-American culture that will be a resource for educators and scholars for many years to come.</p>
