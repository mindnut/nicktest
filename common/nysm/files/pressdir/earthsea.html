<p> The Arm of  the Sea Mask and Puppet Theater will present &ldquo;City that Drinks the Mountain  Sky&rdquo; from 1 to 2 p.m. Through poetry, puppetry and evocative music, this  production follows New York City&rsquo;s water as it  makes its way from the Catskill Mountains to 9  million downstate residents.</p>
<p> From 3 to 4  p.m., James Bruchac, an award-winning author and storyteller at the Ndakinna  Education Center, will tell stories and show tracking techniques that reflect  how Native Americans&rsquo; reliance on the natural world helped shape many Native  legends, cultural values, and social interactions that continue today.</p>
<p> Throughout  the day, Aline F. Gianfagna, of the College  of Nanoscale Science and Engineering  at the state University at Albany,  will talk about alternative energy applications of nanotechnology, the science  of the super small, and how it can be used to solve the world&rsquo;s global  ecosystem and environmental problems.</p>
<p>  With help from Regina Willis, a student  conservation associate of the Hudson River Estuary Program, visitors will be  able to build a 21-foot puzzle of the river that will include details about its  history, physical features and wildlife. Bryan Weatherwax, of the State Museum&rsquo;s  Fish Lab, will display live fish and Museum specimens found in the river. Margaret  Phillips of the United States Geological Survey will ask participants to play  the part of a water droplet in a water cycle game. </p>
<p>Ron Gill, who is with the  Biodiversity Research Institute, will explain how invasive species may threaten the state&rsquo;s native biodiversity. Forest Ranger Karen Glesmann and Smokey Bear  will be on hand to discuss forest protection, while Dee Strnisa, an educator  with the Five Rivers Environmental   Education Center  and Project WET (Water Education for Teachers), will have live reptiles and  amphibians on hand, including some that are threatened. Ralph Rataul, Janice Morrison and Susan  Winchell-Sweeney, of the Museum&rsquo;s Anthropology Lab, will discuss how  archaeology is used to answer questions about how people once lived. </p>
<p>  Katie Buckley, of the Adirondack Council,  will provide tips on saving energy and discuss the Council&rsquo;s first-of-its kind  citizen-participation carbon-retirement program, which prevents the emission of  thousands of tons of carbon dioxide from power plants. Leslie Polsinello, of  the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), will  talk about how to make homes and offices more energy efficient without  sacrificing comfort. </p>
<p>  Information on how campers can have the  least possible impact on the landscape will be available from Ted Beblowski,  master educator with the Leave No Trace program. Volunteers with Friends of the  Pine Bush Community, Inc. will display plant materials and animal specimens. Visitors  will also be able to examine extinct and endangered animal specimens and touch  real mastodon and orca whale teeth through activities led by Museum Educator  Nancy Berns.</p>
<p>Master Gardeners Victoria Shipp and Ellen  Magenis, of Cornell Cooperative Extension, will introduce gardening fun that  includes worms, seedlings and beanstalks as well as other hands-on activities. </p>
<p>  Peggy Steinbach, the Museum&rsquo;s art  instructor, will invite visitors to help create a mosaic of a bird using  household and manufacturing waste materials that were rescued from a landfill. Robin  Tubolino, of Nature Revealed, will provide ideas on how old or used objects can  be transformed into useful items, such as bird feeders, flowerpots, kites,  sandals and jewelry. </p>
