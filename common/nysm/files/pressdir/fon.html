<p> <em>Focus on Nature VIII: Natural History Illustration</em> opens April 24 at the New York State Museum, showcasing world-class, juried artwork by top illustrators from nine countries. </p>
<p>This exhibition, open through September 12 in Exhibition Hall, will feature 108 natural history illustrations, representing the work of 71 illustrators from the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France, Korea, Portugal and Spain. Subjects range from common garden plants, originally from South Africa, to an endangered bird in the Amazon, to the surreal illustration of a protein. </p>
<p>Many of the artists will be available to discuss their work at a reception, open to the public, on May 20 from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. At that time, the winner(s) of the Purchase Award (s) will be announced.  Awarded artwork is added to the Museum's collection of over 15,000 biological, geological and cultural illustrations.</p>
<p>A five-member jury of artists and scientists selected the pieces on exhibit, based on the illustration's educational value and artistic quality. The exhibition's goal is to demonstrate the important role illustration has in natural science research and education, to stimulate curiosity about the world, and bring clearly into focus images of nature that people might not otherwise be able to visualize. </p>
<p>"For many centuries, illustrators have kept pace with natural history science by communicating and recording the results of discoveries and research, as well as by expressing our relationship with the natural world," said Patricia Kernan, exhibition curator and scientific illustrator at the Museum.  "The works in this exhibition are examples of how this tradition is being carried on to ever wider and deeper levels of understanding and sophistication. While illustrators continue using watercolor and other traditional materials, increasingly, they are using computers for the final production of their work." </p>
<p> Kernan said many of the illustrations are done for publications such as field guides, textbooks, science articles and presentations.  Often, a publisher will require a digital submission, which means the computer is used at some point in the process. A catalog of illustrations in the exhibition will be available on May 20 at the reception or it can be ordered by contacting bseymour@mail.nysed.gov.</p>
<p>The <em>Focus on Nature</em> exhibition began in 1990 with 23 artists. It is held every two years and complements the biennial Northeast Natural History Conference on May 19-23, which is organized by the New York State Museum and the New York State Biodiversity Research Institute. The conference updates scientists, educators and students on research in the northeastern United States and Canada.  More information on the conference can be found at www.nysm.nysed.gov/nhc. </p>
