<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A New York State Museum scientist  is part of a team that is the first to use tiny radio transmitters to track  bees over long distances in a forested habitat, yielding new insight into the  role of bees as pollinators in tropical forest ecosystems.<br />
 The bee  study conducted by Dr. Roland Kays, the Museum&rsquo;s curator of mammals, and the  other team members, was published in the online journal PLoSONE (<a href="http://www.plosone.org/">www.plosone.org</a>)  and is available at. <a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010738">http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010738</a>. PLoSONE is an interactive open-access journal for the communication of  all peer-reviewed scientific and medical research. <br />
  Armed  with radio antennas, Kays and the other researchers worked at the Smithsonian  Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, to track unique signals  from 300 milligram transmitters glued to individual orchid bees. Although transmitters  were recently used to track bees in open areas, this is the first time it has  been used in forested habitats, which offers additional tracking challenges. The  research opens the door to future studies of bees in temperate forests, such as  those in New York   State.<br />
 Bees are important pollinators for  plants worldwide. Pollination is critical for plants to make fruits and seeds,  including domesticated edible fruits, as well as inedible species that are  found in most New York   State forested habitats. However,  little is known about the movement of bees because they are so small and  difficult to track. <br />
Researchers, sometimes tracking from a helicopter,  discovered that the orchid bees traveled surprisingly long distances, zipping through  tropical forest and across rivers and lakes as they moved pollen between rare orchids  and other flowers that grow miles apart.<br />   People disrupt plant pollination as they disturb  and destroy forests,&rdquo; said David Roubik, senior staff scientist at STRI and  co-author on the paper, &ldquo;Radio-tracking significantly improves our  understanding of bees and the plants they pollinate. Now we can track orchid bees to get at the  distances and spatial patterns involved&mdash;vital details which have  completely eluded researchers in the past.&rdquo; <br />
   The researchers chose 17 iridescent  blue-green orchid bees called <em>Exaerete  frontalis</em> -- fairly common in the forest.  They are larger than New York  state honeybees but similar to some of the state&rsquo;s other large bumble bees. &ldquo;These bees easily carry a 300 mg radio  transmitter glued on their backs,&rdquo; said Martin Wikelski, co-author of the paper  and director of the Max Planck Institute of Ornithology and a STRI research  associate. &ldquo;By following the radio signals, we discovered that male orchid bees  spent most of their time in small core areas, but could take off and visit  areas farther away. One bee even crossed  over the shipping lanes in the Panama Canal,  flying at least five kilometres, and returned a few days later.&rdquo;<br />
    In  the past, researchers have struggled to determine the distances that bees  travel, following individuals marked with paint between baits, or using radar,  which doesn&rsquo;t work when trees are in the way. &ldquo;Carrying the transmitter might reduce  the distance that the bees travel, but even if the flight distances we recorded  are the minimum distances that orchid bees fly, they are impressive,  long-distance movements,&rdquo; said Kays, who is also a research associate at STRI.  &ldquo;These data help to explain how orchids these bees visit can be so rare and  still get cross- pollinated.&rdquo;<br />
   STRI, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the New York State Museum  and the National Geographic Society provided support for the bee study. Other co-authors are affiliated with the University of Arizona,  Tucson; Cornell University  and EcolSciences, Inc. <br />
   In  addition to hand tracking bees, Wikelski, Kays and colleagues have set up the  Automated Radio Telemetry System at STRI&rsquo;s research station on Barro Colorado  Island in the Panama   Canal. The system is available to interested researchers and is  capable of tracking up to 200 different animals, 24 hours a day, at any given  time.<br />
   A  unit of the Smithsonian Institution, STRI furthers the understanding of  tropical nature and its importance to human welfare, trains students to conduct  research in the tropics and promotes conservation by increasing public  awareness of the beauty and importance of tropical ecosystems.

   The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Started  in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural  history research and collection survey in the United States. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, it is open daily  from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.  Admission is free.
