<p>ALBANY &ndash; New York State Museum  geologists, historians and curators will share their knowledge and research on  a wide variety of topics in a series of fall lunchtime lectures &ndash; &ldquo;Brain Food  for the Curious &ndash; Collections of the State   Museum&rdquo;.</p>
<p> All lectures are free and will be held on selected  Wednesdays from 12:10 to 12:50 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. Lecture topics and dates are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>September 7 &ndash; &ldquo;The 10th Anniversary: Ten Years of       Documentation and Collecting.&rdquo; The State Museum       has been in the forefront of efforts to document and preserve artifacts       from the Sept. 11 attacks and their aftermath. Its collection is the       largest and most comprehensive in the world. The effort has been among the       Museum&rsquo;s most daunting experiences. Curator of History Craig Williams       reviews that effort and reflects on the challenges still being faced</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>September       14 &ndash; &ldquo;The Keene Valley Landslide: Geologic Hazards in the High Peaks.&rdquo; On May 4, 2011, the largest       landslide in New York state history       occurred one mile northwest of the hamlet of Keene       Valley, at Porter       Mountain in the high peaks region       of the Adirondacks. Approximately 82       acres of land and five homes are presently affected, one of which is       totally destroyed. State Museum geologist Dr. Andrew Kozlowski will explain       how he monitors and evaluates this geologic hazard and the implications       for future landslides in the Adirondacks.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>October       5 &ndash; &ldquo;Lewis Henry Morgan&rsquo;s Iroquois Survey and Collection: A New York and       Anthropological First.&rdquo; In 1847, the New York State Regents agreed to fund       a forward-looking collection and survey in Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)       communities proposed by pioneer anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan, then a       young Rochester       lawyer. Curator of Ethnography and Ethnology Dr. Betty Duggan focuses on       the trendsetting nature of Morgan&rsquo;s Iroquois-collaborative fieldwork       (1848&ndash;1850) and the continuing legacy of this stunning collection of       objects and supporting fieldwork records (1848&ndash;1850), which resulted in       the world&rsquo;s first published ethnography, or study of a  culture (1851).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>October       12 &ndash; &ldquo;New York       Mastodons.&rdquo; Mastodons are one of the most abundant Ice Age fossils found       in New York       state. Many examples are now on display in museums around the world. Dr.       Robert S. Feranec, curator of vertebrate paleontology, discusses mastodons       and some famous New York discoveries, including Peale&rsquo;s Mastodon, the       Warren Mastodon, and the State Museum&rsquo;s own Cohoes Mastodon.</li>
  <li>October       19 &ndash; &ldquo;Treasures in the New         York State Museum African American History       Collection.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Senior Historian Dr. Jennifer Lemak  discusses this small but growing collection that covers over 200 years of New York state history. The collection  includes items relating to slavery, the Civil War, Marcus Garvey&rsquo;s Universal Negro  Improvement Association, the New Negro movement, the Great Migration, World War  II, and the Civil Rights movement. </p>
<ul>
  <li>October       26 &ndash; &ldquo;How to Collect Whales.&rdquo; Collecting whales is not an easy thing to       do. This lecture and show-and-tell reveals how these leviathan creatures       go from being washed up on a beach to becoming part of the State Museum&rsquo;s mammal collection. Dr.       Roland Kays, the State Museum&rsquo;s curator of mammals, and Joseph Bopp,       the State Museum&rsquo;s mammal collections       manager, also present recent scientific discoveries in studying whale       specimens.</li>
  <li>November       2 &ndash; &ldquo;The Minerals Story: From Field to Collections.&rdquo; Dr. Marian Lupulescu,       curator of geology, will share the secret stories of discovery of a 343-pound       &ldquo;giant&rdquo; spinel, &ldquo;gieseckite,&rdquo; &ldquo;hudsonite,&rdquo; amazonite, blue phlogopite, and       more. He will explain the journey       of minerals from the field location to the State Museum&rsquo;s       mineral collection. </li>
  <li>November       16 &ndash; &ldquo;The NYSM (New York        State Museum)       Bird Collection: 175 Years of Specimen-based Ornithology.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Dr. Jeremy Kirchman, the State       Museum&rsquo;s curator of birds, will provide a behind-the-scenes overview of       the ornithology research collection, which comprises nearly 20,000 skins,       skeletons, taxidermy mounts, whole fluid-preserved specimens, and frozen       tissue samples. The collection has enabled several generations of       scientists to study the ecology and evolution of birds, and is used today       to address questions concerning global climate change and the genetics of       bird populations.</li>
  <li>November       30 &ndash;&ldquo;Remembering the People of Willard.&rdquo; During the 1995 closure of Willard Psychiatric Center,       nearly 400 suitcases and trunks were discovered, belonging to individuals       who were admitted to this state hospital in the early and mid-20th       century. Curator of History Craig Williams will provide the context to the       suitcase story and discuss some of those whose lives are reflected by       these remarkable artifacts. </li>
