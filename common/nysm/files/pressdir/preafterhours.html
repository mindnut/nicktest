<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - Look back after hours with the New York State Museum. On <strong>Thursday, Aug. 26,</strong> the Museum will host an evening of jazz from <strong>5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Dwight Sills, a nationally recognized jazz guitarist, will perform in the Museum's fourth-floor Terrace Gallery that overlooks the Empire State Plaza. Sills' current release is "Easy" on Citylights Music. Between sets, Museum curators will offer tours of the Museum's latest exhibit -- <em>Looking Back: The State Museum in the Year 2000.</em></p> 
<p>"This is a way to reach out to some of our visitors who have a hard time getting here during the day," Museum Director Cliff Siegfried said. "In addition to enjoying some very fine music, they can also get a chance to see a very special exhibit."</p>	
<p>The Big House Brewing Company is providing food and drinks. Plans are underway to make After Hours events a mainstay at the Museum.</p> 
<p><strong>Looking Back</strong> features about 200 of the State Museum's greatest treasures, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1932 Packard, which he bought with his own money while governor of New York. Other items include breathtaking minerals, a cabinet of curiosities and a steam engine. The exhibit offers visitors a chance to see how Museums collect.</p> 		
<p>Admission to this event is $5 per person in advance. Members of the Museum may bring one guest at no extra charge. Anyone wishing to attend may call 518/474-5801 to purchase tickets. The event is also sponsored by WHRL and NY Press and Graphics.</p>
