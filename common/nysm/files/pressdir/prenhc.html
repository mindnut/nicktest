<p>ALBANY, NY -- Scientists and naturalists from around the Northeast will meet from <em>Oct. 14-17</em> at the New York State Museum to discuss ways to help preserve imperiled freshwater mussels, restore butterfly species and read a 350 million-year-old sea floor.</p>
<p>Those are a few of the many topics to be discussed at the <em>New York Natural History Conference V: A Forum for Current Research</em>. The conference will examine natural history research in the state, focusing attention on critical research needs. There will be a special session devoted to invasive plants, such as purple loosestrife. The biology of this plant as well as what policies need to be developed by agencies, particularly state agencies, will be discussed. </p>
<p>&quot;This conference will be a great opportunity for many natural history scientists and researchers to get together and share their research findings,&quot; conference organizer Ron Gill said. &quot;Any person who is interested in some aspect of New York's natural history is welcome to attend.&quot;</p>
<p>David Doubilet, the award-winning National Geographic underwater photographer, will be the conference's keynote speaker. He will speak Thursday, Oct. 15. The time will be announced at a later date. His presentation is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Natural history artists - who often work side-by-side with scientists to render plants and organisms - will also participate in the conference. An exhibit of their work <em>Focus on Nature V: Natural History Illustration </em>will be displayed in the State Museum's West Gallery from Oct. 15 through Dec. 15. </p>
<p>Some highlights of the conference workshops, which are open to the public for a fee:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freshwater Mussels of New York</em>:<br /> Freshwater mussels were once abundant in New York state. Now, due to pollution they've become imperiled. And some have even become extinct. A workshop will be held to discuss the future of mussels.<br />
This workshop will cover the collection, preservation and identification of 50 species of pearly mussels as well as life histories, distribution and ecology. Participants may bring their own shells to be identified. Presented by David Strayer of the Institute for Ecosystem Studies. Oct. 14, 1-5 p.m.</li>
<li><em>Butterfly Friendly and Beyond</em>:<br /> Restoring and nurturing butterfly presence isn't just about planting flowers that attract butterflies. It is about a whole concept of maintaining an environment where butterflies are permanent residents. The workshop will focus on maintaining a diverse butterfly habitat. Lepidopterist David Bouton will present the workshop. Bouton, who has traveled throughout the world studying and photographing butterflies, will also display his photographs in the illustration show. Oct. 17, noon-5 p.m.</li>
<li><em>Dragonfly and Damselfly larvae of New York</em>:<br /> Ecological and conservation issues regarding dragonflies and damselflies will be featured in this workshop. Participants can bring their own specimens for identification. Oct. 17, 1 p.m.-4 p.m.</li>
<li><em>The Museum's Walls: Record of a 350 Million-year-old sea floor</em>:<br /> Llenroc Stone (&quot;Cornell&quot; spelled backward) from Ithaca was used to construct the lower walls of the State Museum and the Empire State Plaza. Dr. Ed Landing, state paleontologist with the geological survey, will show how you can &quot;read&quot; the evidence from these rocks for powerful bottom currents, giant storm waves and a food chain based on water-logged land-plant debris and large worm-like animals. Oct. 17, from 1-2 p.m. and from 3-4 p.m. </li>
<li><em>Botanical and Habitat Photography</em>:<br /> Outdoor photographer Frank Knight will give a slideshow presentation on his methods for photographing plants and their habitats. A brief field trip around the museum will follow. Some of the topics include close-up techniques, use of flash outdoors, depth of field control and equipment needed. Oct. 14, 1-4 p.m.</li>
<li><em>Color Theory Applied to Natural History Illustrations</em>:<br /> Louisa Rawle Tine, instructor at the NY Botanical Gardens will discuss the confusing complexities of color theory. She will focus on mixing and using colors typically found in nature, such as greens and browns. Oct. 17, 9 a.m.-4 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registration payment, $65 ($45 for students), is due by Sept. 14. Workshop registration fees vary. For more information, visit the State Museum's website: www.nysm.nysed.gov.  </p>
