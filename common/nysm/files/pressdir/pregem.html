<p>ALBANY, N.Y. -- Did an ancient meteorite crash into the Catskills? Is that fossil you have from your junior high science project millions of years old? And what exactly causes a geode to form?</p>
<p>Geologists, mineralogists and paleontologists can answer those questions at the New York State Museum's Gem and Mineral Show &amp; Sale on Saturday, Feb. 20, and Sunday, Feb. 21.</p>
<p>Programs conducted for both days during the Gem &amp; Mineral Show held in the Museum's Terrace Gallery overlooking the Empire State Plaza and Capitol include: </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Minerals of New York State: This program will feature a lecture and slide presentation by Mineralogy Collections Manager Michael Hawkins highlighting the best of the approximately 50,000 gems and minerals, including the famous Herkimer diamonds, in the Museum's collections. 1 p.m.</li>
<li>Specimen Identification: Have a stunning crystalline rock you're just using as a paperweight? Bring it in. Dr. William Kelly, the curator of mineralogy, can tell you exactly what is holding down your paper. Wonder just how old that fossil is that you have on your shelf? Dr. Ed Landing, the state paleontologist, will tell you approximately how many of millions of years old it could be. 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</li>
<li>Panther Mountain: An Ancient Meteorite Crater? Dr. Yngvar Ishachsen, a Museum geologist, will present his hypothesis of an ancient meteorite impact structure in the Catskill Mountains. 3 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, surplus, unaccessioned fossils and mineral specimens from the Museum's collections will be sold. More than 20 vendors will display and sell gems, jewelry, minerals, books, videos, lapidary equipment, silver and goldsmithing equipment and more.</p>
<p>Admission to the Gem &amp; Mineral Show and Sale is $3 per person and $2.50 for Museum members. Children 12 and under are free.</p>
