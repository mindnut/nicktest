<p>On January 25th, the New York State Museum opens an exhibition celebrating the life and work of Paul Robeson, an African-American whose extraordinary talents helped shape the tumultuous course of 20th century America.<p>
Open through March 23 in the Photography Gallery, Paul Robeson: Spirit of a Culture presents and interprets Robeson's multifaceted contributions to America and the world through his embodiment of the universal traits of African-American culture. The exhibition showcases approximately 200 photographs, documents, and objects offering a comprehensive view of all aspects of Robeson's life. This includes his athletic prowess, his theatrical, cinematic and musical triumphs, his participation in the civil rights and labor movements, his support of U.S. and Allied efforts in World War II and his personal life with his family and in his church. </p>
<p>Born the son of a former slave, Robeson was a Phi Beta Kappa at Rutgers with a law degree from Columbia, and was the only African-American selected for special honors in 1972 as a charter member of the National Theater Hall of Fame.  His character infused and informed the popular culture of the 1930s and 1940s. As a top concert artist, he helped to establish the Negro Spiritual and multinational folk songs as accepted art forms. A radio and recording artist, Robeson was the first African-American to star in non-stereotypical roles in feature films.</p>
<p>The exhibition was organized by the Paul Robeson Foundation, New York and is circulated by the Council for Creative Projects in Lee, Mass. The exhibition's core material comes from the collections of Paul Robeson and his wife, Eslanda Cardozo Goode Robeson, now owned by their son, Paul Robeson Jr.  Much of the exhibition's content was originally organized in 1998 to commemorate the centenary of Robeson's birth and this national exhibition tour presents it to the public for the first time.</p>
<p>Many of the era's greatest photographers are represented in the exhibition including Edward Steichen, Yousuf Karsh, Carl Van Vechten, Roy DeCarava, Gordon Parks, Austin Hansen and Morgan 
and Marvin Smith. Robeson is shown in his many film and stage roles, in concert and at a variety of public events. Candid images made throughout his lifetime reveal the private person behind the artist and the public figure.<p>
Rare photographs portray Robeson's spectacular career as an intercollegiate athlete. He won 14 varsity letters, was twice named All-American by legendary Walter Camp and was elected to the National Collegiate Hall of Fame.  Also included are diary entries, letters, correspondence with world figures, sheet music and books.  He is shown in the company of W.E.B. DuBois, Eugene O'Neill, Eleanor Roosevelt, Nikita Kruschev, Albert Einstein, Nehru and many other world leaders.
Audio and video selections highlighting Robeson's stage career and work in human rights are also included in the exhibition.</p>
