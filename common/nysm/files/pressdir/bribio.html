            <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> The New York State Legislature created the Biodiversity Research Institute in 1993 to help meet the challenges associated with preserving the state&rsquo;s biodiversity. The BRI serves as a comprehensive source of information, which is used to advise both public and private agencies on matters relating to the status of New York&rsquo;s biological resources. Housed within the New York State Museum, the BRI is funded through the Environmental Protection Fund. The BRI includes several collaborators, including the State Museum, the New York Natural Heritage Program, Audubon New York, the state Department of Environmental Conservation, New York, Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and The Nature Conservancy.
