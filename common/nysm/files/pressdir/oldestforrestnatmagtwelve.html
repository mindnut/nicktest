<title>FLOOR OF OLDEST FOREST DISCOVERED IN SCHOHARIE COUNTY</title>

<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; New York State  Museum researchers and scientists from  Binghamton University  and Cardiff University have reported the discovery of  the floor of the world&rsquo;s oldest forest in a cover article in the March 1 issue of <em>Nature,</em> a leading international  journal of science.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It was like discovering the  botanical equivalent of dinosaur footprints,&rdquo; said Dr. William Stein, associate  professor of biological sciences at Binghamton   University, and one of  the article&rsquo;s authors. &ldquo;But the most exciting part was finding out just how  many different types of footprints there were. The newly uncovered area was  preserved in such a way that we were literally able to walk among the trees,  noting what kind they were, where they had stood and how big they had grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Scientists  are now piecing together a view of this ancient site, dating back about 385  million years ago, which could shed new light on the role of modern-day forests  and their impact on climate change.</p>
<p> The recent discovery  was made in the same area in Schoharie  County where fossils of the Earth&rsquo;s  oldest trees &ndash; the Gilboa stumps &ndash; were discovered in the 1850s, 1920 and again  in 2010 and were brought to the State   Museum. The Museum has  the world&rsquo;s largest and best collection of Gilboa fossil tree stumps<strong>. </strong>For decades scientists did not know  what the trees connected to the stumps looked like. That mystery was solved  when Linda VanAller Hernick, the State   Museum&rsquo;s Paleontology  collections manager, and Frank Mannolini, Paleontology collections technician, found  fossils of the tree&rsquo;s intact crown in a nearby location in 2004, and a  28-foot-long trunk portion in 2005. The discovery of the 385-million-year-old  specimens was named one of the &ldquo;100 top Science Stories of 2007&rdquo; by <em>Discover</em> Magazine. Stein, Mannolini, Hernick,  and Dr. Christopher M. Berry, a paleobotany lecturer at Cardiff  University in Wales, co-authored a <em>Nature</em> article reporting that discovery,  as well as the most recent one. Working in conjunction with Stein, Mannolini  also developed a sketch of the ancient forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This spectacular discovery and the  resulting research provide more answers to the questions that have plagued  scientists for more than a century since the first Gilboa stumps were uncovered  and brought to the State   Museum,&rdquo; said Hernick,  whose passionate interest in the fossils date back to her childhood exposure to  the Gilboa fossils. </p>
<p>In 2003 Hernick wrote &ldquo;The Gilboa  Fossils,&rdquo; a book published by the State   Museum, about the history  and significance of the fossils and their use in an iconic exhibition about the  Earth&rsquo;s oldest forest that was in the Museum&rsquo;s former location in the State  Education Department building on Washington    Avenue. One  of the key planners of the exhibition, which influenced generations of  paleontologists, was Winifred Goldring, the nation&rsquo;s first female state paleontologist  who was based at the State   Museum. She worked  tirelessly to study and interpret the Gilboa fossils and named the trees <em>Eospermatopteris, </em>or &ldquo;ancient seed  fern.&rdquo; In 1924, her paper about the stumps, together with the Museum  exhibition, brought the &ldquo;Gilboa forest&rdquo; to the attention of the world. One of  the Gilboa stumps will be on display in the Museum lobby, beginning March 2.</p>
<p>Following the discovery of the tree&rsquo;s  crown, a thorough investigation was conducted by Stein and Dr. Christopher M.  Berry, a paleobotany lecturer at Cardiff  University in Wales and the other co-author of  both <em>Nature</em> articles. They were able  to determine that these trees actually resembled modern-day cycads or tree  ferns, but interestingly enough, were not related to either one. Many questions  still remained about what the surrounding area looked like, whether other plant  life co-existed with these trees and how.</p>
<p>In 2010, during ongoing repair of the  Gilboa Dam, New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)  engineers excavated infill from a quarry in Schoharie County. They agreed to allow researchers to re-examine  the site where the fossils had been found when the dam was built in the 1920s. What  they found this time was a large, substantially intact portion of the ancient  forest horizon, complete with root systems. As they had expected, <em>Eospermatopteris</em> root systems of  different sizes were the most abundant.  But what they didn&rsquo;t expect to find was the level of detail of the  overall composition of the forest.</p>
<p>The first glimpse of the unexpected  complexity of this ancient forest came when Stein, Berry, Hernick and Mannolini found the  remains of large scrambling tree-sized plants, identified as aneurophytaleans.  These plants were likely close ecological associates to the original trees,  living among them on the forest floor like modern ferns, possibly scrambling  into the forest canopy much as tropical vines do today. The aneurophytes are the first in the fossil  record to show true &ldquo;wood&rdquo; and the oldest known group in the lineage that lead  to modern seed plants. </p>
<p>Work on the new discoveries also  pointed to the vital importance that the State Museum&rsquo;s  collections have played in the paleontological research. &ldquo;Discovery of scrambling aneurophytaleans at  Gilboa was a complete surprise, but pointed to the likelihood that similar  material had already been found at the site, but was unrecognized,&rdquo; said  Hernick. &ldquo;Sure enough in the State   Museum collections a  wonderful specimen, originally collected in the 1920s, provided additional key  evidence.&rdquo; </p>
<p> The team  also came across a tree belonging to the class Lycopsida, or club mosses, which  predates an earlier discovery made in Naples,   NY and an ecologically important  group in the history of land plants. The lycopsids are an ancient group of  non-seed plants represented today by low growing forms such as the &ldquo;running  pines&rdquo; of the northern hardwood forests of New York. They also inhabited swamps and  ended up being much of the Pennsylvanian coal we burn today. </p>
<p> Based on the  new research, the team now believes that the area probably enjoyed a wetland  environment in a tropical climate. It was filled with large <em>Eospermatopteris</em> trees that resembled  weedy, hollow, bamboo-like plants, with roots spreading out in all directions,  allowing other plants to gain a foothold. Scrambling among these roots on the  forest floor were aneurophytaleans, acting much like ferns do today, and  possibly climbing into the forest canopy as vines. The lycopsids, although  seemingly rare, may also have been very important in certain places although  perhaps not yet as specialized inhabitants of swamps. </p>
<p>But what the research team believes  is most important about this particular site is what it was doing to impact the  rest of the planet. At the time the Gilboa forest began to emerge -- during the  Middle Devonian period, about 385 million years ago &ndash; Earth experienced a  dramatic drop in global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the associated  cooling led ultimately to a period of glaciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trees probably changed everything,&rdquo;  said Stein. &ldquo;Not only did these emerging forests likely cause important changes  in global patterns of sedimentation, but they may have triggered a major  extinction in fossil record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Stein, it all comes down to one  thing &ndash; how much we don&rsquo;t know but need to understand about our ancient past. &ldquo;The  complexity of the Gilboa site can teach us a lot about the original assembly of  our modern day ecosystems,&rdquo; said Stein. &ldquo;As we continue to understand the role  of forests in modern global systems, and face potential climate change and  deforestation on a global scale, these clues from the past may offer valuable  lessons for managing our planet&rsquo;s future.&rdquo;</p>
