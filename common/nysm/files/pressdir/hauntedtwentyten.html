<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Museum&rsquo;s 9h  annual &ldquo;Haunted Museum of Unnatural History&rdquo; will feature a tribute to characters and ghouls from Hollywood and storybook legends. </p>
<p>  The &ldquo;Haunted   Museum&rdquo; will be open  October 23 and 24 from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and October 30 from 11 a.m. to 4:30  p.m., reopening from 6 to 10 p.m. On Halloween, October 31 visitors are welcome  between 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The event will be located in the Student Center on the Museum&rsquo;s first floor. </p>
<p> The &ldquo;Monster Mash &amp; Bash&rdquo; will  provide light-hearted fun for younger children, ages 10 and under. Children  and their families are invited to come in costume to the Museum&rsquo;s fourth floor  Terrace Gallery on October  23, 24, 30 and 31, from noon to 4 p.m. for face-painting, Halloween crafts and  goofy games. A costume  parade around the Museum will be held at 1 p.m. </p>
<p>  Brave souls who enter the &ldquo;Haunted Museum&rdquo;  will weave their way through a dark maze and encounter the unknown (and undead)  around every corner. Monsters, real and imagined, will appear and disappear  when least expected. A heart-pounding soundtrack and light show will amplify  the anticipation. Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and a host  of werewolves, zombies and mummies will make an appearance. Visitors will  encounter the Tomb of the Undead, Zombie    Place, the Wolf&rsquo;s Den, Blood  Castle and Clown Town. </p>
<p>  The &ldquo;Haunted Museum&rdquo;  is too intense for children under 10 and is designed especially for teens,  college students and adults who love to be scared. Visitors are asked not to  wear costumes for safety reasons. </p>
<p>  Proceeds from both events will benefit the Museum&rsquo;s award-winning  after-school programs for Albany  city youth. Admission to the &ldquo;Haunted   Museum&rdquo; is $8. &ldquo;Monster  Mash&rdquo; admission is $2. Museum Club and Discovery Squad teens work with a Museum  educator throughout the fall to design, build and decorate the Haunted Museum. Local high school and college  students, artists, musicians, carpenters and actors all contribute their time  and talent. </p>
