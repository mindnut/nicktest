<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; &ldquo;Spring has Sprung &rsquo;&rsquo; will be the theme of the New York State Museum&rsquo;s next Family Fun Weekend, April 7 and 8. <br />
  
The &ldquo;Family Fun Weekend, Presented by Fidelis Care&rdquo; takes place from 1- 4 p.m. both days. Activities, which are free of charge, are held in Bird Hall, on the Museum&rsquo;s first floor. <br />
Throughout the afternoon visitors can make a ceramic flower magnet to paint and hang on the refrigerator or a spring-themed stained glass panel to hang in a window.Children can also choose a spring design to have painted on their faces.

Capital Repertory Theatre commissioned playwright Ed. Lange to write a work about the Iroquois appropriate for grades 3 and up. &ldquo;A Song&rsquo;&rsquo; is part of Capital Repertory&rsquo;s spring school performance series. It was inspired by the work of Albany painter Thomas Dorsey, Jr., who is also known by his Indian name, &ldquo;Tom Two Arrows.&rsquo;&rsquo; The play is also based on interviews with Michael Tarbell of the Iroquois Indian Museum. The <br />
contemporary story follows what happens when a young lacrosse player, frustrated that he has not made a team, encounters people of the Longhouse. <br />
