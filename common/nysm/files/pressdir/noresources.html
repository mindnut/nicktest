<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Museum will present a March  lecture and film series &ndash; &ldquo;Life on a Small Planet&rdquo; &ndash; focusing on the financial  meltdown, as well as issues related to the sustainability of the world&rsquo;s  natural resources. </p>
<p><strong> </strong>The<strong> </strong>free lectures and films  will be offered on Wednesdays at 7 p.m. and Sundays at 2:30 p.m. in March in  the Huxley Theater. The schedule is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wednesday, March 4 &ndash; &ldquo;The Global       Predicament: Increasing Consumption, Decreasing Abundance of Resources.&rdquo; </strong>Museum geologist Dr. Taury Smith will discuss current       trends in population growth and resource consumption and provide the       latest scientific information on global oil supplies and other trends in       resource consumption and depletion. </li>
  <li><strong>Sunday, March 8 -- &ldquo;Screening of <em>Power of Community: How Cuba       Survived Peak Oil.&rdquo;</em></strong> Alice Oldfather, an Albany       resident concerned about the implications of peak oil, will introduce the       film and lead a discussion on what lessons can be learned from Cuba&rsquo;s       experience. Cuba       survived a 75 percent decrease in oil consumption when imports from the       former Soviet Union suddenly stopped. The       film is 60 minutes long. </li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday, March 11 &ndash; &ldquo;Global       Cooling?&rdquo; </strong>Dr.       Smith will discuss the latest scientific data.       Climate change can be caused by both natural phenomena and human       activity. Evidence suggests that the Earth is in cooler phases of natural       climate variations, but that this is likely to change in the next few       years<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday, March 18 &ndash; &ldquo;Why You       Should Think About Peak Oil, Climate Change, and Economic Collapse When It       Seems Much Nicer Not To.&rdquo; </strong>This lecture will be presented by Sharon Astyk, the       author of <em>Depletion and Abundance:       Life on the New Home Front</em> and the forthcoming <em>A Nation of Farmers</em> (with Aaron Newton, Spring 2009). She also       homeschools children, teaches,and is a subsistence farmer in upstate       New York.<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Sunday, March 22 &ndash; &ldquo;Screening of<em> Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladahk.&rdquo;</em></strong> This film, by Helena Norberg       Hodge, examines the impact of economic globalization on successful       centuries-old practices in the high Himalayan region of Ladahk, India.       Sharon Hoffman, an Albany       resident who spent two summers in Ladahk, will introduce the film, show       slides from her trip to the region, and lead a discussion. The film is 60       minutes long.<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday, March 25 &ndash; &ldquo;The       Financial Meltdown and the Economics of Sustainability&rdquo; </strong>Dr. John Gowdy, a professor and  ecological economist at RPI, will discuss the shift from a growth economy to a  sustainable economy and how the world might then function. Topics covered will include  the current revolution in economic theory, the ongoing financial meltdown,  global climate change policy, and more.<strong></strong></li>
