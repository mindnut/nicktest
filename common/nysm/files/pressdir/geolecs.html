<p>ALBANY &ndash;New York  State Museum  geoscientists will discuss their investigations of New York&rsquo;s past and present and the state&rsquo;s  relationship to the larger world in a series of weekly lectures in April at the  Museum.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The<strong> </strong>free lectures will be  offered on Wednesdays at 7 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. Scientists will explain  how their research in the field lab and office is mixed, on a daily basis, with  work involving Museum collections and exhibitions, as well as with outreach to  government agencies, teachers, industry and the public.</p>
<p> The schedule  and topics are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>April  1 &ndash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mines, All Mines.&rdquo; Dr. William Kelly, state geologist, will discuss his  research on the economic impact of mining in New York. He also recounts the adventure of  the 1994 collapse of the world&rsquo;s largest rock salt mine, located in western New York.</li>
  <li>April  8 &ndash; &ldquo;Dates, Rates, and Geologic Hazards: Surficial Geology.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Dr.  Andrew Kozlowski, a glacial geologist, will describe several current research  projects investigating sediment-landforms, their chronology, and geologic  hazards.</li>
  <li>April  15 &ndash; &ldquo;Old Bones, Caves, and Chemistry.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Dr.  Robert S. Feranec, curator of vertebrate paleontology, will discuss the  importance of recent excavations of fossil mammals in New   York and Spain.  He also will talk about how paleontologists glean information about paleoecology  and dating from the fossils after they are removed from the ground.</li>
  <li>April  22 &ndash; &ldquo;Ancient Seas, Ancient Volcanism.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>A  geologist&rsquo;s job is to better understand geological processes and the Earth&rsquo;s  history. Dr. Chuck Ver Straeten, a sedimentary geologist, will examine  the mysteries of New York  and the world around 400 million years ago and reveal the fate of  volcanic ash layers in ancient seas and lakes. </li>
  <li>April  29 &ndash; &ldquo;Understanding the Geology of the Adirondacks.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Dr.  Marian Lupulescu, curator of geology, talks about his research topics and how  he uses the Museum&rsquo;s collections and field data to uncover geologic secrets of  the Adirondack Mountains and Hudson   Highlands.</li>
