Named for its bird-like sound, recorders vary in size and sound from the small supranino to the very large great bass, and are usually played in combination on various parts. The recorder is often used in elementary school to teach the basics of reading music because of its simplicity and affordability. <br />
The recorder was developed during the Middle Ages and was played throughout Europe. Most popular during the Renaissance and through the Baroque period, it was replaced in the 18th century by the transverse flute, a more versatile instrument. <br />
The Germans rediscovered the recorder during the early 20th century, and informal groups began assembling to play recorder music. This movement spread throughout Europe and to the United States where the American Recorder Society was founded in 1939. Some 90 chapters of the American Recorder Society exist in most every state and serve a membership of 3200. The Hudson Mohawk chapter serves the Capitol District and meets twice a month at the Historic Pruyn House in Colonie.<br />
