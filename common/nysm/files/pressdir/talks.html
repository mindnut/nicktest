<div id="main"> 
<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State   Museum will offer  lectures on a variety of topics this fall, highlighting the diverse work of the  Museum&rsquo;s scientists and historians. </p>
<p><strong> </strong>From October 1 through December 17, the free lectures will be held every  Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. The topics are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>October 1 &ndash; &ldquo;Insect Biodiversity       in the World&rsquo;s Wild Places.&rdquo; </strong>Museum scientist Dr. Jason Cryan, an entomologist and       evolutionary biologist, will discuss his ongoing efforts to document       insect biodiversity in the rapidly disappearing jungles and rainforests of       the world.</li>
  <li><strong>October 8&mdash;&ldquo;Virtual Tour of the       Fish Lab.&rdquo; </strong>Curator       of Ichthyology Dr. Robert Daniels will provide a virtual tour of the       Museum&rsquo;s fish collection, which contains more than 1 million specimens.       The collection serves researchers around the world and is the basis for       studies on natural history, zoogeography, and taxonomy of fishes. This       virtual tour includes stops to identify interesting specimens and       research.</li>
  <li><strong>October 15 &ndash; &ldquo;Archaeology of New York&rsquo;s Early       Hydroelectric Industry.&rdquo; </strong>The Hudson River Electric Power Company&rsquo;s substation in       East Glenville, built in 1903, had a pivotal place in the early       development of power transmission in New York. Martin Pickands, an       archaeologist with the Cultural Research Survey Program, will discuss the       structure of the substation and the function of its components.</li>
  <li><strong>October 22 &ndash; &ldquo;Hunter-Fisher-Gatherers       in the Upper        Ohio Valley.&rdquo; </strong>Between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago, Native Americans  in northern West Virginia first turned to the Ohio River to support their foraging way  of life. Dr. Jonahan Lothrop, curator of archaeology, will describe how recent  discoveries at the East Steubenville site shed  new light on this unique Native American adaptation in West Virginia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>October 29 &ndash; &ldquo;The Hungerford       Brothers and the Rocket Car.&rdquo; </strong>Aviation pioneers, inventors, <strong> </strong>and promoters Daniel and Floyd  Hungerford didn&rsquo;t realize their dream of going to the moon in a rocket car but Senior Historian  Geoffrey Stein will discuss their story and offer an illustrated lecture,  followed by a visit to the rocket car, on display on the Museum&rsquo;s 4th  floor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>November 5 &ndash; &ldquo;The Basket at the       Center of the World.&rdquo; </strong>In 1984, archaeologists digging in lower Manhattan made an intriguing discovery       underneath the 17th-century ground surface: a unique basket       filled with remarkable things. Dr. Charles Orser, curator of historical       archaeology, will discuss the basket and its contents and explain why they       are important.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li><strong>November 12 &ndash; &ldquo;The Irony of Independence:       Emancipation Celebrations.&rdquo; </strong>Dr. Jennifer Lemak, curator of African-American history,       will provide information on the first celebration of the abolition of       slavery on July 4, 1827. The irony that the first celebration was held on       Independence Day was experienced again 136 years later, when New York&rsquo;s       centennial celebrations of the Emancipation Proclamation took place in the       midst of the Civil Rights Movement. </li>
  <li></li>
  <li><strong>November 19 &ndash; &ldquo;Tales from the       Mineralogy Collection.&rdquo; </strong>The Museum&rsquo;s mineral collections are essential       scientific, educational, and cultural resources. Dr. Marian Lupulescu,       curator of geology, will present his research on the identification and       description of new mineral species, mineral structures, and historical       features of some classic mineral, rock, and ore localities of New York.</li>
  <li><strong>December 3 &ndash; &ldquo;Protecting       Biodiversity by Reducing Chemical Pesticides.&rdquo; </strong>In the 1980s, Museum researchers       helped develop a safe, biological method for black fly control in the Adirondack Mountains, and, as a result, the use of       polluting chemical insecticides stopped. Dr. Daniel Molloy,       director of the Museum&rsquo;s Field Research Laboratory, will discuss how       history is being repeated with the development of a green alternative to the       poisonous chemicals used to control the zebra mussel, an invasive,       pipe-clogging species from Europe. </li>
  <li><strong>December 10 &ndash; &ldquo;Discovering the       Life of the Steamer <em>Baltic.&rdquo; </em></strong>Ron Burch, curator of art and       architecture, will discuss the process of discovery in researching a       mid-19th-century ship&rsquo;s &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; in the Museum&rsquo;s collection.       Inquiry into the history surrounding Samuel Walters&rsquo; painting of a storm-tossed  transatlantic steamship disclosed a web of personal risk and corporate high  stakes on the high seas. Participants may view the painting following the  lecture.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>December 17 &ndash; &ldquo;Birds Are       Dinosaurs: Avian Origins and Evolutionary Affinities.&rdquo; </strong>The idea that birds are       descended from dinosaurs has become the consensus view of ornithologists       in the past 15 years. Dr. Jeremy Kirchman, curator of birds, will discuss       the many new lines of evidence that link modern birds to the extinct       dinosaurs and explain how scientists reconstruct the evolutionary       relationships among groups of species.</li>
