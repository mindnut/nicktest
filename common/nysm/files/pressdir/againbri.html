<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Biodiversity Research Institute  (BRI) and the New York State Museum  will present weekly lectures in April focusing on recent biodiversity research,  conservation and education initiatives in New York State. </p>
<p> All lectures are free and will be held on  Wednesdays at noon in the Huxley Theater. Lecture topics and dates are: </p>
<p>April       1 <strong>&ndash; </strong>&ldquo;Acid Rain, Mercury       Deposition, Forest Birds, and Electricity:       Are They Linked?&rdquo; Coal burned to produce electricity releases not only       greenhouse gases, but also ions responsible for acid rain and mercury       deposition. Dr. Stefan Hames, research associate at the Cornell Laboratory       of Ornithology, presents research, from a network of sites across New York, into the       relationships between declines in some nesting bird species, soil properties,       and these pollutants.</p>

  <li>April       8 &ndash; &ldquo;Emerging Ecology of the Worm Invasions: Predatory Planarians and       Non-native Earthworms.&rdquo; Dr. Peter K. Ducey, of the Department of       Biological Sciences at the State University of New York College at Cortland, discusses       how soil ecosystems are often dominated by many species of non-native invertebrates.       The interactions of invasive predatory planarians (from Asia) and       non-native earthworms (presumably from Europe and Asia)       with each other, and with native species, have created new ecological       dynamics. Study of these interactions may shed light on the role of       evolution in the shaping of predator-prey interactions and on the potential       impacts of the invasions.</li>

  <li>April       15 &ndash; &ldquo;Predicting and Mitigating Hotspots of Herpetofauna Road Mortality.&rdquo; Mortality       of amphibians and reptiles is a serious problem on public roads in New York state. Dr.       Tom Langen, associate professor of biology at Clarkson University,       presents his research findings on how locations of road-kill hotspots can  be accurately predicted using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). He also discusses how this predictive  tool can be used to develop a program of road network surveys and mitigation  planning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>April       22 &ndash; &ldquo;Long-term Responses of Breeding Birds to Habitat Loss and Fragmentation.&rdquo;       As the first-ever resurveyed state bird atlas, the <em>New York State Breeding Bird Atlas</em>, provides a unique opportunity       to study the long-term responses of breeding birds to changes in habitat       availability. Dr. Benjamin Zuckerberg, a post-doctoral associate at the       Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, presents research on the responses of       forest birds to patterns of forest cover throughout New York.</li>

<p>The New  York State Legislature created the Biodiversity Research Institute in 1993 to  help meet the challenges associated with preserving the state&rsquo;s  biodiversity. The BRI serves as a  comprehensive source of information,  which is used to advise both public and private agencies on matters relating to  the status of New York&rsquo;s  biological resources. Housed within the New York State Museum,  the BRI is funded through the Environmental Protection Fund. The BRI includes several collaborators,  including the State Museum; New York  State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation; State University  of New York; New York State Department of Environmental Conservation; Audubon New York; New York  Natural Heritage Program and The Nature Conservancy. Further information is available at: <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri/">http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri/</a> or by  calling (518) 474-6531. </p>
<p> The New York State Museum  is a cultural program of the New York State Education Department. Founded in  1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history  research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is  open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New  Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be obtained by calling  (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
