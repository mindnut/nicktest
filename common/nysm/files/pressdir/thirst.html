<p style="text-align:justify;">The  New York State Museum will host the upstate premiere of the 30-minute film <em>Thirst:  A Civil War Story </em>(2013) on Saturday, May 11 from 1pm to 3pm in the Huxley  Theatre. The film is presented as part of the Museum's exhibit <em>An Irrepressible Conflict: The Empire State  in the Civil War</em>, a 7,000-square foot exhibition commemorating the  sesquicentennial of the Civil War (on display through September 22). The free screening  will be followed by a panel discussion with cast and crew. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written,  directed and edited by upstate New York filmmaker John McCarty, <em>Thirst: A  Civil War Story </em>is inspired by the work of Stephen Crane, the author of <em>The  Red Badge of Courage</em>. It tells the story of a young Union volunteer from  New York State who runs from a fight in the days following the battle of  Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863). Exhausted and out of water, he comes upon a well  that, unknown to him, is guarded by Confederate soldiers. A fellow New Yorker,  also a deserter, rescues him from becoming a victim to his thirst. Desperate  and without water, the two concoct a dangerous plan to seize the well from its  Confederate captors. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  production of the film, shot entirely in the Capital Region, coincides with the  150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the American Civil War in which New York State  contributed more troops and suffered more casualties than any other state in  the embattled Union. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  The film's producer, Audrey E. Kupferberg, lecturer and director of the film  studies minor at the University at Albany, solicited volunteers among her film  studies students to work on the crew alongside cinematographer Jeffrey A. Grove  and other professionals. According to Kupferberg, the film will be of interest  not only to Civil War buffs and fans of author Stephen Crane, but also to young  people and anyone interested in the process of filmmaking on a regional,  non-industry basis. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  film's young cast includes SUNY Albany students Derek H. Mellina, John Mac  Schnurr, and Nick Brigadier, plus Mark G. David and Pete D'Amica, members of  the upstate New York film and theater community. Area Civil War re-enactor and  historian Robert Keough served as technical advisor and plays a key part in the  film as well.</p>
