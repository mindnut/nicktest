<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Nationally-known  historian Kenneth T. Jackson will  present a lecture on &ldquo;The Future of History in New York State&rdquo; on  Thursday, November 19 at the New York State Museum. </p>
<p>One of the country&rsquo;s leading scholars  in American history, Jackson will address New York State&rsquo;s powerful and unique, but largely  unheralded role in American history in a free public lecture at 7 p.m. in the  Huxley Theater. </p>
<p>Jackson has for years championed the  importance and excitement of New    York State  history. He appeared at the State Museum in 2006 when he delivered an essay &ldquo;But it was  in New York: America  Begins in the Empire   State.&rdquo; It challenged  historians to convince their &ldquo;fellow citizens that today&rsquo;s America took shape in yesterday&rsquo;s New York.&rdquo; Expanding on  that theme Jackson will examine subsequent  events, including the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial, the State Museum&rsquo;s  proposed permanent exhibition on state history, the creation of the New York  Academy of History, new public school curricula and more.</p>
<p>Jackson is currently the Jacques Barzun Professor  of History and the Social Sciences and director of the Herbert  Lehman Center  at Columbia University. </p>
<p>Funded in part by the New York State  Council for the Humanities, the lecture is part of a two-day conference November  19-20 on &ldquo;Researching New York: Perspectives on Empire State History.&rdquo; The  conference brings together historians, librarians, teachers, researchers,  archivists, museum curators and documentary producers, enabling them to share  their interest and their work in New    York State  history. It provides a forum for the exploration of all aspects of state  history, in all time periods and from diverse perspectives. </p>
<p>Other conference programs, open to  registrants only, will be held at the University at Albany&rsquo;s uptown campus. The conference is  sponsored by the New York State Archives Partnership Trust and the University  at Albany&rsquo;s  Department of History, the History Graduate Student Organization and the M.E. Granander Special Collections &amp; Archives.</p>
