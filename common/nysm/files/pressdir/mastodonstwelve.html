<title>STATE MUSEUM RESEARCH: MASTODONS, MAMMOTHS CO-EXISTED IN NYS </title>

<p>ALBANY, N.Y.  &ndash; State Museum scientists have used radiocarbon dating to show that mastodons and  mammoths, which lived about 12,000 to 15,000 years ago, co-existed in New York  state. </p>
<p>Dr.  Robert Feranec, the Museum&rsquo;s curator of vertebrate paleontology and Dr. Andrew  Kozlowski, glacial geologist and acting associate state geologist, co-authored  the research that appeared in the latest edition of the journal <em>Radiocarbon. </em>The open-access article is available at <a href="https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16009">https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16009</a>.</p>
<p>This  research may help scientists to better understand how the modern ecosystems of New York formed. Ice covered almost the  entire area of the state  during the height of the ice age about 25,000 years ago. Ice age mammals, such  as mastodons and mammoths, could only enter the region after the ice melted. The timing of the migration  has been uncertain. The scientists hope their  continuing research may show a pattern of how animals established themselves  and which ones came first. </p>
<p>Mastodons  and mammoths represent the most abundant species of large Pleistocene (ice age)  animals recovered in New York.  However, many of them had not been dated. Feranec and Kozlowski reported the  radiocarbon dates on bone from seven mastodons and three mammoths stored in the  Museum&rsquo;s collections. </p>
<p>Testing  showed that the Tunkamoose mastodon dates to approximately 15,000 years ago,  which is the oldest date for a mastodon in New York state. Two tusks from this mastodon were discovered  by two canoeists in November 2008 in the Black Dirt area of Orange County  at the confluence of Tunkamoose Creek and the Wallkill River.  One tusk measured more than nine feet and the other less complete tusk was  about 5-6 feet long. </p>
<p>It  was determined that the most recent date for a woolly mammoth recovered in the  state is the Randolph mammoth, dating to about 12,000 years ago. It was  discovered in May 1934 during expansion of the East Randolph Fish Hatchery in Randolph. At present, these  remains represent the most complete woolly mammoth skeleton found in the state.  It consists of the skull, two tusks, the left lower third molar and distal  portions of the right ulna, right radius and left femur.</p>
<p>This  research project was primarily funded by the United States Geological Survey&rsquo;s  state mapping program.</p>
