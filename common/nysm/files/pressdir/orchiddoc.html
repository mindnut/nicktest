<title>NYS MUSEUM SCIENTIST REPORTS DISCOVERY OF NEW ORCHID SPECIES</title>

		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">ALBANY &ndash; A New York State Museum botanist and a Colorado scientist have discovered a new species of orchid and have described their research findings in a recent study published in a highly respected botany journal.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> Dr. Charles Sheviak, curator of botany at the State Museum, and William Jennings, a Colorado geologist, reported their discovery in the journal Rhodora in March. Sheviak discovered the new plant, Platanthera tescamnis, while surveying orchids as part of his research on the relationships within the species of this wide-ranging group. Although the plant had been known for many years it had previously been misidentified. It differs in appearance from other orchids in the genus and is the only species that lives in relatively dry habitats in the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau, a region of the country that is normally hot and arid. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> Jennings, who has an intimate knowledge of Colorado flora, raised the possibility that the plant had been misidentified after coming across it in Colorado. Sheviak, an authority on orchids who has worked at the Museum for 30 years, has published many articles on orchids, including other descriptions of new species. But this particular species was a challenge to orchid taxonomists because of the confusion surrounding the group as a whole. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> In order to conserve an area, biologists and resource managers alike need to understand the biology of the species present. At a minimum, they need to be able to recognize the plants and animals and relate them to their particular habitats. This begins with accurate descriptions of each species.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Sheviak made several field trips and studied hundreds of museum specimens before discovering that the orchid was something that was previously undescribed and was a new species. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> The orchid has small green and yellowish flowers, grows from 1 to 2 feet, and occurs in Colorado, Utah and Nevada, reaching the bordering areas of Arizona and California. This particular plant is not found in New York State. However, there are about 17other species of Platanthera that are. Sheviak described the 17th species in 1999, clearing up some uncertainty that dated back to 1918. </p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0;"> Orchids are distributed throughout the world but the large, showy types are uncommon in North America. The orchids in the U.S., like the Platanthera, have small flowers. </p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Started in 1836, the museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research and collection survey in the United States. The State Museum is located on Madison Avenue in Albany. It is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information about programs and events can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at www.nysm.nysed.gov.</p>
