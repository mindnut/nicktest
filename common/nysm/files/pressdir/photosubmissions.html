<p>ALBANY, NY  -- The New York State Museum is inviting the public to submit their digital  photographs of scenic New York   State landscapes, the  best of which will be showcased in an upcoming Museum exhibition and displayed  on the Museum website and Flickr page. </p>
<p>Scenic landscapes exist in every  corner of New York   State and are often found  on picture perfect postcards that read &ldquo;wish you were here.&rdquo; The State Museum&rsquo;s  exhibition, <em>Wish You Were Here! New York  State Photographed by You</em> will open in the State Museum&rsquo;s  West Hall Corridor on September 3, featuring a selection of the best landscape photographs  submitted by the public. These can be photographs of a beloved vacation spot or  even the backyard, neighborhood street or other favorite place. Images chosen  for the exhibition, as well as others that are submitted, will also appear on  the Museum&rsquo;s website. Photographs will still be accepted after September 3, since  new ones will continually be added to both the gallery and website.</p>
<p> <em>Wish You Were Here</em> will complement another  exhibition in the Museum&rsquo;s adjacent West Gallery -- <em>Not Just  Another Pretty Place:  The Landscape of New York.</em> Also opening on  September 3, this will be the first exhibition of landscape art to be culled  from the Museum&rsquo;s vast collections.</p>
<p> Those  wishing to submit photos for <em>Wish You  Were Here</em> will find further information at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/wishyouwerehere">www.nysm.nysed.gov/wishyouwerehere</a></p>
