<title>Capital Region BioBlitz 1999: State Museum Scientists to Record all Living Things on Peebles Island</title>

<p>WATERFORD, NY -- Scientists will BioBlitz Peebles Island State Park on noon Friday, July 30 until noon Saturday, July 31, in an attempt to record all living species there.</p>
<p>The intense 24-hour biological census of Peebles Island is being organized by the New York State Biodiversity Research Institute (BRI) at the State Museum. The purpose of the BioBlitz is to generate public awareness to the concept of biodiversity, meaning the total variety of living organisms and the natural processes that support them, and to evaluate the biological resources that can exist near urban areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, the data obtained will be used as an indicator of the environmental quality of the park and as a baseline for future monitoring or management plans.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an amazing variety of species in and near urban environments,&quot; Museum Director Cliff Siegfried said. &quot;Many people don't even realize that there are hundreds of types of insects in their backyard alone. This is way to dramatize the incredible diversity of species.&quot;</p>
<p>About 50 scientists and researchers from the Museum, the State Department of Environmental Conservation, local universities and the New York Natural Heritage Program will participate. They will note everything they see or hear including bats, grass, moths, slugs, birds, lichens and snakes. The tally will be announced every few hours at the base camp. Results will be available in several weeks since some specimens will have to be identified in laboratories.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people don't realize the significant biological diversity they can find in their local city and town parks,&quot; said organizer Karen Frolich, a biodiversity specialist at the Museum. &quot;Even scientists have only recently discovered the value of viewing cities as ecosystems.&quot;</p>
<p>Peebles Island is about 12 miles north of Albany and consists of 158 acres of wetlands, grasslands and upland hardwood forest. An early fall survey in 1996 found 156 species of plants, including eight considered to be vulnerable, 11 mammal species, one frog species, one snake species and 140 species of birds, including eight that are endangered, threatened or vulnerable.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, this biodiversity is often threatened by humans in some way,&quot; said Ron Gill of the BRI. &quot;By increasing awareness, through events such as this BioBlitz, we hope that more people will care and be concerned with the future of this biodiversity.&quot;</p>
<p>The BRI was created in 1993 by the State Legislature to help meet challenges associated with preserving the state's biodiversity. Pursuant to Section 235-a (2,3) of State Education Law, the BRI serves as a comprehensive source of biological information to be used to advise both public and private agencies on the status of New York's biological resources. The BRI is funded through the Environmental Protection Fund.</p>
<p>The first BioBlitz was sponsored by the National Park Service and the National Biological Service and was held in Kenilworth Park, Washington, D.C., in 1996. Surrounded by heavy residential and industrial development, it had been considered to be devoid of any significant biological diversity. However, scientists tallied more than 900 species during that BioBlitz.</p>
<p>Plans are already underway to make the BioBlitz an annual occurrence in the Capital Region. Next spring, researchers plan to gather at the Papscanee Island Nature Preserve in East Greenbush. </p>
