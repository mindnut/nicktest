<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, N.Y. <strong>&ndash; </strong>Nationally-acclaimed hip-hop violinist, composer<strong> </strong>and band leader<strong> </strong>Daniel Bernard Roumain will perform in a concert for Capital  District middle and high school students on Thursday, January 21 at the New York State Museum.</p>
<p> The free  after-school special event will be held at 3 p.m. in the Museum&rsquo;s Clark  Auditorium. It is a production of The Egg Empire Center for the Performing Arts,  The New York State Museum and Black Dimensions in Art, Inc. CDTA is assisting  with transportation for some students.</p>
<p> Roumain, also  known as DBR, will present a musical autobiography, illuminating his artistic  inspiration, and perform excerpts of his work, which combines classical music  with rock and hip-hop. He will also  discuss and demonstrate his approach to composing music. The Haitian American  artist has carved a reputation for himself as an innovative composer,  performer, violinist, and band leader who melds his classical music roots with  his own cultural references and vibrant musical imagination. </p>
<p> Proving that he&rsquo;s &quot;about as  omnivorous as a contemporary artist gets&quot; (<em>New York Times</em>), DBR recently collaborated and performed with Lady  Gaga on FOX&rsquo;s &ldquo;American Idol.&rdquo; He has been featured on the CBS Evening News  segment &ldquo;Assignment America,&rdquo;spotlighted as a &quot;New Face of Classical Music&quot; (<em>Esquire </em>Magazine), chosen one of the  &quot;Top 100 New Yorkers&quot; (<em>New York  Resident</em>), &quot;Top 40 Under 40&quot; business people (<em>Crain&rsquo;s New York Business</em>) and named one  of the entertainment industry&rsquo;s &quot;Top 5 Tomorrow&rsquo;s Newsmakers&quot; (1010  WINS Radio). </p>
<p> DBR  regularly composes for orchestras and chamber music ensembles around the globe  and tours with his  genre-jumping ensemble DBR &amp; The Mission. He will be a soloist with the  Vancouver Symphony Orchestra for the Canadian premiere of Voodoo Violin  Concerto at the Vancouver 2010 Olympics on February 14. </p>
<p> A native of Margate, Florida,  DBR studied music as an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University&rsquo;s Blair School of Music where he currently  serves as a visiting professor ofcomposition, and completed his masters and doctoral work  at the University   of Michigan under the  tutelage of Pulitzer Prize-winning composer William Bolcom. </p>
