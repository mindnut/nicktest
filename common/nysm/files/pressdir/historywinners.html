<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Twenty five middle and high school students from  throughout the Capital District won top prizes in the Capital Region History  Day Contest at the New York State Museum  and will advance to the state competition in Cooperstown  on April 30. </p>
<p>The contest, held March 27, attracted 175 students from  schools in Albany, Clifton  Park, Delmar, Guilderland, Schenectady, and Granville.  They competed in the preliminary regional competition of the National History  Day Contest. The national theme for this year&rsquo;s competition is &ldquo;Innovation in  History: Impact and Change.&rdquo;</p>
<p> After working on their entries for  many months, competitors qualified for the regional contest by doing well at  contests held at individual schools throughout the area. Students researched  history topics of their choice related to the theme to create exhibits,  documentaries, performances, research papers and website designs. Participants  included students in grades 6-8 in the Junior Division and grades 9-12 in the  Senior Division. The winners will go on to the state competition in Cooperstown April 30.  The program culminates  in the Kenneth E. Behring National History Day Contest June 13-17 at the University of Maryland  at College Park, Maryland.</p>
<p>There  were two special prizes for those in the regional competition. This year&rsquo;s  Archives History Award was won by Michael Gao and Nate Costello of Shenendehowa High School  in Clifton Park, under the supervision of teacher  Amber Quinn. Their winning project, submitted in the Senior Websites Division,  was &ldquo;The Curtis Steam Turbine: A Case Study of American Innovation in  Engineering.&rdquo; They each won a $100  savings bond each.</p>
<p>The Daphne C. Cotter Women's History Award went to Rachel  Nash of Shenendehowa   High School, who also  worked with teacher Amber Quinn. Her project in the Senior Individual Exhibits  category was on the &ldquo;Impact of the Special Olympics.&rdquo; She won a certificate and  a $20 Borders gift card. </p>
