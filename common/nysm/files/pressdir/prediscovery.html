<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - There will be no "Do Not Touch" signs in the all-new Discovery Place at the New York State Museum. The interactive area will re-open Saturday, May 22, featuring hands-on and computer exhibits for children of all ages. A special all-day celebration encompassing the entire Museum will be held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>The Discovery Place will include SciWorks, new computers, microscopes and an exhibit where kids can construct a mastodont. A ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>"Kids can be entomologists, historians, physicists and paleontologists at the new Discovery Place," said State Museum Director Cliff Siegfried. "It's just the beginning of where the State Museum is heading - toward a more interactive and a more visitor-friendly atmosphere."</p>
<p>The State Museum, a program of the State Education Department, is in the midst of formulating a master plan that will rejuvenate its exhibits.</p>
<p>The renovation of the Discovery Place is made possible by a $50,000 gift from Fleet Financial Group, a strong supporter of the Museum. IBM is sponsoring five computers. The SciWorks hands-on exhibits include a Bernoulli Blower, Conic Sections, a Pedal Generator and a Hand Battery.</p>
<p>The State Museum, home to dozens of researchers, historians and scientists, will also host presentations throughout the exhibit halls on May 22.</p>
<p>* At 1 and 3 p.m., historian Christine Kleinegger will present "New York ... Sleeps." She will talk about her current research on sleeping habits. At the Long House.</p>
<p>* At 1 p.m., archaeologist George Hamell will talk about mastodonts. At the Ice Age diorama.</p>
<p>* Between 1 and 4 p.m., scientists and other researchers will use live specimens to talk about their particular specialties. In the Museum Theater. The presenters include: aquatic biologists Bob Daniels and Dan Molloy, who will talk about crayfish, crabs and zebra mussels; curator Todd Hunsinger, who will give a presentation on amphibians and reptiles; and lepidopterist Tim McCabe will speak about butterflies and moths.</p>
<p>* Between 2 and 3 p.m., Native American specialist Toni Benedict will hold a workshop on making cornhusk dolls.</p>
<p>Other activities include presentations on Adirondack animals, folk tales and songs, and storytelling. McGruff the Crime Dog and Rowdy the Albany River Rat, the mascot of the American Hockey League team, will be on hand to welcome families to the Museum. Albany City Police Officers will also fingerprint kids in the Main Lobby.</p>
