<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - A Green Island man has generously donated a 1947 fire engine to the New York State Museum today in memory of his parents and to honor the fire department that often came to their aid.</p>
<p>The lives of Tim McGan's parents, Jay and Alice McGan, were extended by the ministrations of Green Island emergency service personnel. His mother died in 1999, 10 years after his father passed away. This 1947 American-LaFrance 700 pumper actually came to their assistance.</p>
<p>"The last time I saw the truck in service was at my mom's," said McGan, a senior account clerk with the state Comptroller's Office. "I wanted to help the village. I've always enjoyed antique fire trucks. And ever since I saw this display at the Museum, I just said this old '47 wasn't going to disappear into the wilderness." McGan purchased the engine from the Village of Green Island Fire Department in May with money his parents had left him.</p>
<p>The engine will be placed on exhibition in the Museum's fire-fighting exhibition in the Museum's East Gallery.</p>
<p>"We are extremely grateful to Mr. McGan for donating this engine to the people of the state of New York. Now, it will be placed on exhibition for all to see," Museum Director Cliff Siegfried said.</p>
<p>"The American LaFrance 700 series represents a radical post-World War II modification in fire engine design," said Geoffrey Stein, the curator of the fire truck collection at the museum. The 700 was the first cab forward pumper. The 700 series prompted the other builders of fire apparatus in the country to follow with their own short wheelbase, flat-front rigs, Stein said.</p>
<p>The 700 American-LaFrance was perhaps the Elmira company's most successful model, and was sold all over the country. The example being donated to the Museum, a program of the State Education Department, was purchased in 1947, the first year for the 700s, by the village of Green Island. And the rig remained in service until 2000.</p>
<p>The newly acquired fire engine will be placed in the Museum's Fire Engine Hall along with a dozen other fire apparatus.</p>
