<title>New York State Museum Becomes Affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution</title>

<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - The New York State Museum became an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, officials announced today.</p>
<p>In addition to the 6 million artifacts in the State Museum's collection, New Yorkers will now have access to even more objects through the Smithsonian Institution Affiliation Program.</p>
<p>This affiliation allows the State Museum, a program of the State Education Department, to borrow artifacts from the Smithsonian's 140-million-object-collections for long-term use.</p>
<p>New York's First Lady Libby Pataki initiated the State Museum's affiliation with the Smithsonian. Gov. George Pataki and the First Lady are both advocates of museums and culture across New York State.</p>
<p>&quot;The New York State Museum is New York's Smithsonian. The State Museum's fine collections can only be enhanced by the wealth of treasures held by the many Smithsonian museums,&quot; Gov. George Pataki said. &quot;Together, both institutions will provide New Yorkers with a rich learning experience that will help them better understand our state and nation.&quot;</p>
<p>The Smithsonian, founded in 1846, is the largest museum and research complex in the world. It consists of 16 museums and galleries, the National Zoo and research facilities. 	</p>
<p>&quot;I'm delighted that the New York State Museum has become an affiliate of the Smithsonian, and I look forward to a relationship that will be exciting and rewarding for both institutions,&quot; Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence Small said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now there are even more reasons to visit the State Museum,&quot; said State Education Department Commissioner Richard Mills, who oversees the Museum. &quot;By integrating with the Smithsonian, the Museum will greatly enhance the educational experience of the 40,000 school children who visit each year.&quot;</p>
<p>The State Museum, in the midst of a $60 million makeover, plans to use Smithsonian artifacts within exhibitions in the updated museum.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes our master plan for exhibition galleries even more exciting. The universe of objects that can be used to tell the story of New York State has been expanded by more than the order of magnitude,&quot; State Museum Director Cliff Siegfried said.	</p>
<p>Affiliates may integrate Smithsonian artifacts and collections in exhibitions, educational initiatives and/or research programs. The Affiliations Program provides greater public access to the Smithsonian collections. The goal of the program is to share Smithsonian resources and collections more widely and to enhance relationships with communities throughout the nation.</p>
<p>There are close to 50 museums, including the New York State Museum, throughout the United States participating in the Smithsonian Affiliations Program. The Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents adopted the program in September 1996.</p>
<p>The State Museum has hosted traveling exhibitions from the Smithsonian for short periods of time, such as <em>Theodore Roosevelt: Icon of the American Century</em> on display in the State Museum through July 9. The State Museum is currently researching Smithsonian collections and how its objects can be used in current and future exhibitions.</p>
