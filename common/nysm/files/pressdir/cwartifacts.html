<p style="text-align:justify;">The New York State Museum has added two important artifacts  to its current exhibition commemorating the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the  Civil War, <em>An Irrepressible Conflict: The  Empire State in the Civil War</em>. The artifacts include the notes taken by two  physicians who attended President Lincoln on his death bed and the only  existing oil painting of Dred Scott, the African American slave whose 1858  Supreme Court trial pushed the nation to the brink of Civil War.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The physicians' handwritten notes, penned by Assistant  Surgeon Joseph Janvier Woodward and Lincoln family physician Robert K. Stone,  describe in stark detail President Lincoln's condition after being shot by John  Wilkes Booth on the night of April 15, 1865. Dr. Woodward's notes are stained  with the President&rsquo;s blood. These documents are on loan from the Fenimore  Museum, Cooperstown, New York.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dred Scott gained everlasting fame as the slave whose freedom  was denied in one of the nation&rsquo;s most important Supreme Court cases.&nbsp; In 1858, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney  delivered the court ruling that African Americans had no claim on freedom or  citizenship and that slavery was protected by the Constitution. The decision  increased tensions throughout the nation and contributed to the outbreak of war  in 1861. The Dred Scott decision was overturned by the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment in 1868. The Dred Scott oil painting is on loan from the New-York  Historical Society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An Irrepressible  Conflict: The Empire State in the Civil War</em> is open through September 22,  2013 in Exhibition Hall.  As the wealthiest and most populous state, the Empire State led all others in  supplying men, money, and mat&eacute;riel to the causes of unity and freedom. New  York&rsquo;s experience provides significant insight into the reasons why the war was  fought and the meaning that the Civil War holds  today. In addition to the physicians&rsquo; notes and the Dred Scott  oil painting, the exhibition includes a brass collar worn by a slave in  Canajoharie, New York, the earliest known photograph of human rights champion  Frederick Douglass (on loan from the Onondaga Historical Association), Abraham  Lincoln's 1860 life mask (New-York Historical Society), a steel plate made for  the USS Monitor (Hudson Mohawk Industrial Gateway), handmade artifacts produced  by Confederate prisoners at Elmira Prison (Chemung County Historical Society), and  a Ku Klux Klan robe from Greene County, New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
