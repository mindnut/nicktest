<p>ALBANY &ndash; New York State Museum  geologists, biologists, historians and curators will share their knowledge and  research on a wide variety of topics in a series of fall lunchtime lectures &ndash;  &ldquo;Brain Food for the Curious&rdquo; -- at the State Museum,  beginning September 15.</p>
<p> All lectures are free and will be held on  Wednesdays at noon in the Huxley Theater. Lecture topics and dates are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>September       15 &ndash; &ldquo;Aquatic Critters Are Being Killed. Who Done It?&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Dr. Dan Molloy, the director of the Museum&rsquo;s Field Research       Laboratory, will assume the role of disease detective, calling on his international       network of scientific sleuths, to solve mysteries involving animals &ndash;       especially microscopic ones &ndash; discovered dying in our lakes or rivers.       This is CSI: NYS        Museum on a budget!</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>September       22 &ndash; &ldquo;The Straight Story on the Marcellus Shale.&rdquo; Dr. Taury Smith, an oil       and gas geologist and the curator of subsurface geological collections at       the Museum, will provide information on the geology of the Marcellus       Shale, how and where wells could be drilled and &ldquo;hydrofracked&rdquo; in New York State, and the likely environmental       and economic impact of shale gas production, both locally and globally.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>September       29 &ndash; &ldquo;Global Warming Isn&rsquo;t Going Away.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>The Earth has just experienced the warmest 12 months in       recorded history, yet polls show an American public that is increasingly       skeptical of the scientific consensus position that human activity is       warming the climate. Geologist Dr. Taury Smith will present evidence for       global warming and discusses how media coverage is weakening the case for       action.</li>
  <li>October       6 &ndash; &ldquo;Shaking the Helderbergs:       Earthquakes in Berne, 1980 to 2010.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>When       people think of earthquakes they are likely to think of California,       Indonesia, and China. There       were 23earthquakes in the Helderbergs last year.  Geologists are puzzled by small, deep earthquakes in the town of Berne, 3&ndash;13 miles below the surface. Dr.  Charles Ver Straeten, a sedimentary geologist, will delve into the mystery.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>October       13 &ndash; &ldquo;Human Frogs! The Twisted Story of Two Vaudeville Performers.&rdquo; Friede       and Harry DeMarlo toured the globe between 1910 and 1928 performing       contortionist and trapeze acts. In their most famous act, &ldquo;A Frog&rsquo;s Paradise,&rdquo; they contorted their bodies into       frog-like poses. Dr. Jennifer Lemak, senior historian, will piece together       their extraordinary life based on artifacts in the Museum collection.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>October       20 &ndash; &ldquo;Should We Go Nuclear?&rdquo;<strong> </strong>The       amount of the relatively carbon dioxide-free form of energy generated by       nuclear power plants may increase in the next few years, but there are       some constraints on future nuclear energy use. Dr. Marian Lupulescu,       curator of geology, will analyze the availability of the uranium resources       and the disposal of nuclear waste.</li>
  <li>October       27 &ndash; &ldquo;Zebra Mussels and The Batten Kill: What&rsquo;s the Threat?&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Zebra mussels are unwanted       invaders in New York        State lakes and       rivers, causing harm to native aquatic life. When they were discovered one       year ago in the Batten Kill, a trout stream in Washington County,       residents and sportsmen feared the worst. Research scientist Denise Mayer will       discuss what can be done to protect this river.</li>
  <li>November       3 &ndash; &ldquo;Meet the People of Colonial Albany       Online at the People of Colonial Albany       Live Here Website.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Community       historian Stefan Bielinski will lead an interactive tour of new and       improved features of the community history website dedicated to the 16,000       people who founded and built the city of Albany from 1686 to 1800. The site has       more than 3,000 separate features and millions of visitors every year. New       features are added virtually every day. </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>November       10 &ndash; &ldquo;Qualla<strong> </strong>Arts and the       Federal IACB Among Eastern Native Nations.&rdquo;<strong> <br />
  </strong>Intertribal influences of the Eastern Cherokees&rsquo; famous Qualla Arts       and Crafts Mutual (est. 1946) are largely forgotten. During the 1960s&ndash;80s,       however, their master craftspeople led Indian and Arts and Crafts Board       workshops for other Nations in the East, sparking crafts revitalization in       several. Dr. Betty Duggan, curator of ethnography and ethnology, will discuss       this revitalization.</li>
  <li>November       17 &ndash; &ldquo;Taking the Pulse of the Moving Animal Planet.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>The Earth is in constant motion through the daily patrols and       yearly migrations of animals. Dr. Roland Kays, curator of mammals, will       provide an around-the-world tour of discoveries made with the assistance       of new technologies that allow tracking of bees through the forest, birds       on cross-continental flights, and predators moving into your backyard.</li>
