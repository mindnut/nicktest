<p>Scientists and researchers from the New York State Museum spent several hours today examining the remains of a euthanized, four-ton sperm whale calf beached on Long Island that will eventually make its way to the State Museum.</p>
<p>Scientists from the museum's research and collections staff joined with others from the Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation and the Massachusetts Fish and Wildlife Department in examining the 22-foot male calf which washed ashore on the Jacob Riis National Park beach in the Gateway National Recreation Area on Thursday. </p>
<p>The young calf, believed to be less than two years of age was reported to Gateway National Park personnel after it was found floundering in the surf in an extremely weakened and malnourished condition. The Riverhead Foundation, which operates the New York State marine mammal and sea turtle stranding program, responded to the scene. The young whale was euthanized following consultation with scientists at the National Marine Fisheries Service.</p>
<p>Sperm whales are the largest of the toothed whales and can be found worldwide from the equator to the edges of the polar pack ice. They are usually found in deep canyon waters, the edges of banks and over continental slopes. Listed on New York State's endangered species list, the whales have been recorded as the deepest and longest diving whale. Calves are born every four to six years and may nurse for a minimum of two years and sometimes longer. Adults range in size from 36 to 60 feet in length.</p>
<p>Following the examination, the remains were to be transported to a facility in Belchertown, Mass. operated by the state's fish and wildlife department.  The State Museum's scientists will harvest the whale's skeletal remains for further study and possible display at the museum.</p>
<p>The New York State Museum is a cultural program of the New York State Department of Education. Founded in 1836, the museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. The State Museum is located on Madison Avenue in Albany.
