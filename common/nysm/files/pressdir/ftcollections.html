<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; The New York State Museum celebrates 175 years of adding to the scientific  and historical knowledge of New    York State  with a new exhibition which showcases the Museum&rsquo;s invaluable collections, highlights  the people who built them and the research that has resulted.</p>
<p> On display  in Exhibition Hall until April 30, 2012, &ldquo;<em>From  the Collections</em>&rdquo; features many of the Museum&rsquo;s important collections in  anthropology, history and natural science. It illuminates the history of the  oldest and largest state museum in the nation. Included are highlights of the  more than 15 million scientific and historic artifacts and specimens that make  up the Museum&rsquo;s collections, including perennial favorites, priceless treasures  and new acquisitions.</p>
<p> The Museum  and its collections officially began on April 15, 1836 when Governor William  Marcy appointed the staff of the state&rsquo;s first official Geological and Natural  History Survey to conduct &ldquo;a grand and comprehensive collection of the natural  productions of the State of New York  to exhibit under one roof its animal, mineral and vegetable wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mineral collection &ndash; one of the  Museum&rsquo;s earliest &ndash; contain 35,000 specimens and date back to 1837 when  Governor Marcy appointed Lewis Beck as mineralogist of the Geological Survey.  Many of the minerals he collected during his trips across New   York were incorporated into the State Cabinet of Natural History,  the precursor of the State   Museum. There are 30  minerals on display, some which have never been exhibited before. Some come  from Beck&rsquo;s collection and others were added this past year. </p>
<p>Specimens also are on display from the  Herbarium collection, which documents the flora of the state. In 1836 John  Torrey was employed to carry out botanical studies with the objective of  acquiring every plant species known to occur in the state. The collection now  consists of 200,000 vascular plant specimens, 50,000 bryophytes, 90,000 fungi,  12,000 lichens and countless others. </p>
<p>Also in the natural science section  are colorful, very detailed scientific illustrations and paintings, as well as the skulls of a mastodon, whale and coyotes, as  well as images of the collection and preservation process. Also on display is  the baleen of a whale, which is the filter-feed system inside mouths of baleen  whales. The exhibition also provides information on current research based on  these collections. </p>
<p>The Museum&rsquo;s history collection, with  five million artifacts, dates back to 1901 when the New York State Agricultural  Society donated a collection it had amassed to advance the field of  agriculture. Large equipment, circa 1845-1865, are on display. </p>
<p> The State Museum  has one of the most comprehensive collections of Shaker materials. The exhibition  includes photos of the community and many examples of Shaker-made items  including furniture, clothing, boxes, and molds and forms for their  commercially sold products.</p>
<p> As visitors  enter the exhibition they will see the Weebermobile, a car invented and built  around 1903 by Christian F. Weeber Jr., an Albany native who began building experimental  automobiles in the 1890s, just a few years after the automobile was invented. </p>
<p> Representing  200 years of decorative arts is the E. Eric Martin Wunsch collection, dating  from 1700 to 1900. Furniture, jewelry and other items are on display. Visitors will also see stoneware from the Adam  Weitsman collection and furniture, jewelry and other objects from the J.  Tompkins Family collection. From the vaudeville collection are photos, drums  and other items once used by vaudeville performer Iva Erway Garcinetti, (stage  name Marjorie Miller). </p>
<p> The  exhibition&rsquo;s anthropology section includes historic Native American artifacts  and images from the Museum&rsquo;s extensive ethnology collections, including one amassed  between 1849-1850 by Lewis Henry Morgan, world renowned as &ldquo;the father of  American ethnology.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Other objects are from the collection  of Arthur C. Parker, the first American  Indian Museum  professional and New York   State&rsquo;s first state  archaeologist. He pioneered the use of exhibits for cultural education. His  Iroquois Village Life dioramas, on display from 1918 to 1976 in the old Museum  location in the State   Education Building,  set a new professional standard. </p>
<p>Archaeology collections acquired more  recently by the State Museum include the Mohawk  Valley collection and the South Street  Seaport Museum  collection, transferred from the South  Street Seaport  Museum in lower Manhattan. </p>
<p>Also on display are many artifacts,  including some that are prehistoric, collected through the Cultural Resource  Survey Program, which completes legally required archaeological and  architectural assessments for state and federal agencies. Collections are used in  public outreach and educational programming at the Museum, in schools and in  local communities.</p>
<p>The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously  operating state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is open Monday through  Saturday from 9:30 p.m. to 5 p. m. It is closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas and  New Year&rsquo;s Day.
