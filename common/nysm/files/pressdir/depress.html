<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A new traveling exhibition opens at the New York State Museum  on October 17 showcasing the works of a legendary group of photographers who  documented the lives and struggles of Americans enduring the Great Depression.</p>
<p><em>This Great  Nation Will Endure</em>, open through March 14, 2010, features more than 150  images of America  taken between 1935 and 1942 by the legendary photographic unit of the Farm  Security Administration (FSA). This remains the largest documentary photography  project ever undertaken. The photographs include some of the most familiar and  powerful images of the nation to emerge from the Depression era. Many have  reached iconic status in American culture.</p>
<p>Curated and designed by staff at the Franklin D. Roosevelt  (FDR) Library and Museum in Hyde Park, the  exhibition features images from every region of the nation, culled from the  enormous FSA photography collection (numbering tens of thousands of images) at  the Library of Congress. Included are photographs taken during the 1930s and  1940s by Dorothea Lange, Gordon   Parks, Ben Shahn, Walker  Evans, Arthur Rothstein, Carl Mydans, Russell Lee, John Vachon, Marion Post  Wolcott and Jack Delano.</p>
<p>The FSA was a New Deal agency created by President  Roosevelt in 1937 to help American farmers and farm laborers who were  confronting economic depression and natural disaster, including the ecological  disaster known as the Dust Bowl. It  developed out of an earlier agency called the Resettlement Administration (RA) for  which its director, Rexford Tugwell, had established a publicity department to  document rural poverty and government efforts to alleviate it. That department included a photographic unit called  the &ldquo;Historical Section,&rdquo; administrated by former Columbia University  economics instructor, Roy Stryker. To accomplish the agency&rsquo;s goals, Stryker  enlisted a group of men and women who today comprise a virtual &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who&rdquo; of  20th-century documentary photography. The RA and its &ldquo;Historical Section&rdquo; were  merged into the newly created FSA in 1937. Many of its photographers later  forged careers that helped define photojournalism at magazines like <em>Life</em> and <em>Look</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the photographs<strong> </strong>in the exhibition<strong> </strong>depict  rural life and hardships but they also include many images of town and city life. The FSA created a very  diverse record of American life during the 1930s and early 1940s, including images of hardship,  endurance, hope, recovery, migration, recreation and community life. The  photographs provide visual affirmation of President Roosevelt&rsquo;s bold assertion  in his first inaugural address, delivered at the lowest point of the Great  Depression: &ldquo;This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and  will prosper &hellip; the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The  exhibition also includes a specially commissioned, short documentary film that  explores the work of four of the most prominent FSA photographers. There also  is a soundtrack of folk music sung by migrant workers that was recorded in  migrant worker camps in California  in 1940-41. An interactive computer program allows visitors to explore entire  series of images shot by FSA photographers during individual photo assignments.  Also featured is a short silent video that depicts the ways in which FSA  photography was used in newspapers and magazines of the 1930s and 1940s. </p>
