<title>NYS MUSEUM SCIENTIST CO-AUTHORS STUDY ON WOLVES, COYOTES </title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; A State Museum scientist has co-authored a new research article, representing  the most detailed genomic study of its kind, which shows that wolves and  coyotes in the eastern United    States are hybrids between gray wolves,  coyotes and domestic dogs. </p>
<p> Dr. Roland  Kays, the Museum&rsquo;s curator of mammals, was one of 15 other national and  international scientists who collaborated on the study that used unprecedented  genetic technology, developed from the dog genome, to survey the global genetic  diversity in dogs, wolves and coyotes. The study used over 48,000 genetic markers, making it the  most detailed genomic study of any wild vertebrate species.</p>
<p>The research results are especially  relevant to wolves and coyotes in the Northeast. The study shows a gradient of  hybridization in wolves, with pure wolves in western states and increasing  hybridization as you move east. Wolves  in the western Great Lakes area averaged a genetic makeup of 85 percent wolf  and 15 percent coyote, while wolves in Algonquin  Park in eastern Ontario  averaged 58 percent wolf, and the &lsquo;red wolf&rsquo; in North Carolina was only 24 percent wolf and  76 percent coyote. Populations of eastern coyotes, which only colonized the  region in the last 60 years, were also minor hybrids, with some introgression  of genetic material from wolves and domestic dogs. For example, Northeastern coyotes, including  those in New York   State, had genetic  material primarily from coyotes (82 percent), with a minor contribution from  dogs (9 percent) and wolves (9 percent). Midwestern and southeastern coyotes  were genetically 90 percent coyote, with an average of 7.5 percent dog and 2.5  percent wolf. </p>
<p>The advanced genetic techniques used  in this study also allowed the scientists to estimate when the hybridization  initially occurred. Kays said &ldquo;In most  cases this breeding across species lines seems to have happened at times when  humans were hunting eastern wolves to extinction, and the few remaining animals could find no proper mates, so took the best option  they could get.&rdquo; Kays continues, &ldquo;The exceptions were an older hybridization between coyotes and  wolves in the western Great Lakes dating from 600-900 years ago, and a coyote-dog hybridization in the  eastern U.S.  about 50 years ago, when coyote were first colonizing eastern forests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This study also provides fresh data  on the controversy over the species status of the Red Wolf in North   Carolina, and the Eastern Canadian Wolf in Ontario.  Both are medium-sized wolves that some have argued represent unique  species. However, this new detailed  genetic data shows both are the result of hybridizations between coyotes and  wolves over the last few hundred years, and do not share a common origin in a  unique eastern wolf species. </p>
<p>This research is also relevant to a  recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife proposal to remove the western Great   Lakes wolves from the Endangered Species Act by showing that those  wolves are only marginally hybridized with coyotes, should be considered a  subspecies of the Gray Wolf, and have no genetic ties to a more endangered form  of eastern wolf.</p>
<p>The research is published online in <em>Genome Research,</em> an international,  peer-reviewed journal that publishes outstanding original research that  provides novel insights into the genome biology of all organisms, including  advances in genomic medicine. </p>
<p>This study  follows another research paper co-authored by Kays last year in the journal <em>Biology Letters,</em> which used museum  specimens and genetic samples to show that eastern coyotes hybridized with  wolves to rapidly evolve into a larger form over the last 90 years, dramatically  expanding their geographic range and becoming the top predator in the  Northeast. This hybridization contributed to the evolution of coyotes from  mousers of western grasslands to deer hunters of eastern forests. The resulting  coy-wolf hybrids are larger, with wider skulls that are better adapted for  hunting deer. </p>
<p>In  the past, Kays has also studied coyote diet  and distribution in Albany&rsquo;s Pine Bush and in the  Adirondack Mountains. His research indicated that deer accounted  for approximately one-third of the coyote&rsquo;s diet and that they made extensive  use of forested areas. Kays also writes a blog about his research for the <em>New York Times</em> &ldquo;Scientist at Work&rdquo; feature.  This blog is the modern version of a field journal, a place for reports  on the daily progress of scientific expeditions &mdash; adventures, misadventures and  discoveries.

<p> The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Started  in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural  history research and collection survey in the United States. Located on  Madison Avenue in Albany,  it is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is closed on  Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
