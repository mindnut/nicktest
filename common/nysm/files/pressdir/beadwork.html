		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;">ALBANY &ndash; Two elaborate, beaded traditional Iroquois outfits, completed by hundreds of people </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">in workshops across the United States and Canada, will be the centerpiece of an exhibition that </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">opens at the New York State Museum on Nov. 4.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">Ska-Ni-Kwat (The Power of the Good Mind): Iroquois Beadwork will feature the </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">newly made man&rsquo;s and woman&rsquo;s outfits, along with dozens of examples of traditional </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">beadwork. The exhibition, which runs through April 15, 2007 in Exhibition Hall, represents </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">work ranging from the most inspired to the most commercial. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> Iroquois women, and some men, have been using beads for more than 200 years. During the </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">Victorian era, beaded purses, pin cushions and brooches became highly collectible. The practice </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">moved further from its roots later, as pieces were made to sell to tourists. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> &ldquo;In the early- and mid-1800s, bead workers were making work based on spiritual </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">beliefs, using designs from nature,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Sam Thomas, an Iroquois bead worker and </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">educator who created Ska-Ni-Kwat. &ldquo;Later on, they were making whatever would sell </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">for $2 or $3 and they had no real sense of what it meant.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> For nearly 30 years, Thomas has worked to revive and preserve the Iroquois beading </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">tradition. Through such efforts, it has recently been recognized as a legitimate art form. A </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">growing number of artists work in both the older, ornate designs and in contemporary, </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0;">simpler styles. Today, the emphasis is on artistic expression, not commerce, said Thomas, </p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal">River Reserve, in Canada. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> In 2002, he and his mother, Lorna Thomas-Hill, used grants from the W.K. Kellogg </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">Foundation and the Ontario Arts Council to conduct workshops in museums and cultural </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">centers across the U.S. and Canada, where approximately 2000 participants then used </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">what they learned to sew beads on two Iroquois outfits. The elaborate garments, which </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">include leggings, moccasins and capes, resemble what a woman and a man wore during </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">the post-Colonial era. They are embellished with yokes, cuffs and purses beaded in red, </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">white and blue. As many as 2000 people of all ages, ethnicities and nationalities put more than </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">1500 hours into the project, which Thomas says underscores the rich cultural life of Native </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">Americans in eastern North America. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> &ldquo;We want to show that it is possible for people from different backgrounds to come </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">together to create something,&rsquo;&rsquo; Thomas said. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> Dozens of beaded objects from his collection and the collection of Dolores Elliott, a </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">consultant to the Iroquois Studies Association, will be displayed along with the outfits.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">They will be arranged in themes that address the use of color, common patterns and </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">themes, traditional items and those made for tourists. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> The New York State Museum, established in 1836, is a program of the New York </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">StateEducation Department. Located at the Empire State Plaza on Madison Avenue in </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">Albany, the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, </p>
