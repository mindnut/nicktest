<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Families and friends of abducted children and other missing persons from across the country will gather at the New York State Museum on Sunday, April 6, to talk about their own experiences and to teach other families how to prevent such tragedies. </p>
<p> The event is part of the 7th annual Missing Persons Day ceremony. Missing Persons Day is observed annually on April 6th, Suzanne Lyall&rsquo;s birthday. The former SUNY Albany student has been missing since March 2, 1998.</p>
<p> Dr. Arthur J. Eisenberg, one of the nation&rsquo;s leading authorities on DNA technology, will be the featured speaker at 2 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. He will talk about the ways in which DNA technology is being used to help solve missing persons&rsquo; cases. Dr. Eisenberg helped establish the world&rsquo;s first DNA paternity and forensics laboratory and, over the past 23 years, he has been responsible for the development of many of the systems and methodologies used in the field of DNA identification testing. </p>
<p> Prior to Dr. Eisenberg&rsquo;s speech, a ceremony will be held in the Museum&rsquo;s Huxley Theater, beginning at 1 p.m., with Assembly Minority Leader James Tedisco as master of ceremonies. New York State Trooper Dan Hart will play the bagpipes. </p>

This will be followed by remarks from New York Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings and District Attorney David Soares of Albany County. <br />
 Following the speeches and presentations, members of families with missing loved ones will place wreaths of yellow roses and hold a candlelight vigil at the Missing Persons Remembrance </p>
<p>monument, located on the southeast corner of Madison and Swan Streets. Constructed in 2006, the monument features an eternal flame to &ldquo;light the way home&rdquo; for the missing.</p>
<p>  The New York State Police, the Department of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), and other organizations will be present during the event to hand out literature and answer parents&rsquo; questions. Jim Viola, a filmmaker and husband of Patricia Viola, who has been missing from Bogota, New Jersey since 2001, will present several short videos about a variety of missing person&rsquo;s cases. </p>
<p> The Museum is among several sites in the Capitol Region that hosts a computer kiosk that allows visitors to access information year-round about missing persons. </p>
<p> During the morning of April 6 nearly 200 survivors and friends of missing persons and interested parties are expected to attend a private morning session exclusively for the families and missing person organizations, sponsored by the Center for Hope. </p>
<p> &ldquo;This annual event provides families with missing loved ones with support and guidance,&rdquo; said Doug Lyall. &ldquo;Collectively, we offer one another hope.&rdquo;</p>
