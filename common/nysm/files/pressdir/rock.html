<p>- ICM Artists, LTD. presents the Grammy award-winning a cappella ensemble, Sweet Honey in the Rock in concert on Friday, October 29th at the New York State Museum.</p>
<p>The concert, which begins at 8 p.m. in the Clark Auditorium, is being held in conjunction with three new Museum exhibitions - <em>The Art of African Women: Empowering Traditions</em>; <em>Elder Grace: The Nobility of Aging</em> and <em>Passing the Legacy: Reflections of Our Elders</em>. A pre-concert reception, celebrating the opening of the exhibitions, will be held at the Museum at 6 p.m. for advance concert ticket holders and Museum members. The photographers whose works are showcased in the exhibitions - Margaret Courtney Clarke (<em>Art of African Women</em>), Chester Higgins (<em>Elder Grace</em>) and J. El-Wise Noisette (<em>Passing the Legacy</em>) -- are expected to attend the reception.</p>
<p>The internationally renowned group captures the complex sounds of blues, spirituals, traditional gospel hymns, rap, reggae, African chants, hip-hop, ancient lullabies and jazz improvisation. Sweet Honey's collective voice, occasionally accompanied by hand percussion instruments, produces a sound filled with soulful harmonies and intricate rhythms. Their songs often ring with social and political commentary.</p>
<p>Founded by Bernice Johnson Reagon in 1973 at the D.C. Black Repertory Theater Company, Sweet Honey has roots in the sacred music of the black church. Reagon was inspired by a religious parable her father passed on about a land so rich that honey flowed from the rocks. The image of black women strong as a rock and sweet as honey seemed appropriate. Reagon retired from performing with the group earlier this year and the ensemble became a sextet with the addition of founding member Louise Robinson and Arnae¢, who has worked as a substitute in the group since 1994. </p>
<p>Sweet Honey's newest song "Trust," written by founding member Carol Maillard, is being sold in limited editions at concerts this fall and will be available at the State Museum concert. The ensemble released its 30th year anniversary album, "<em>The Women Gather</em>" in 2003, during a whirlwind, yearlong celebration, which included performances in 13 cities across the U.S. and six cities in England 
and Scotland. In the fall of 2003, the Smithsonian honored Sweet Honey by requesting a 
donation of artifacts from the group for the Smithsonian's permanent Performing Arts collection. </p>
<p>On the horizon this year is a PBS documentary on the ensemble, "A Song for Everyone," produced by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Stanley Nelson. </p>
