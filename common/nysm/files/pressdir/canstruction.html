<p>The third annual Capital Region Canstruction, a design competition benefiting The Food Pantries for the Capital District, will be held at the New York State Museum March 28 through April 11, 2013. Canstruction participants design and build giant-sized unique structures made entirely out of canned goods. This year's participants have been challenged to collect 50,000 cans and $50,000 to support local food pantries. </p>
<p>Ten teams comprised of local architecture, engineering and construction firms, as well as design students, will create canned good sculptures inspired by this year's theme, &quot;Can You Imagine&quot;, at the 4th floor of the State Museum. Participants include CHA, CSArch, Creighton Manning, EYP, Mosaic, Price Chopper, Ryan Biggs, RPI and Sano Rubin. </p>
<p>Sculpture designs include The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Albert Einstein, Wizard of Oz&mdash;The Emerald City, and a leprechaun. All cans used in the displays were purchased from Price Chopper, the major event sponsor, and will be donated to The Food Pantries for the Capital District at the end of Canstruction.</p>
<p>Visitors are encouraged to bring canned goods to the State Museum and participate in the Canstruction competition. Visitors can use their canned goods as ballots to help determine the winner of the <br />
  Community Choice award. Other awards, including &quot;Best Use of Labels&quot; and &quot;Structural Ingenuity&quot;, will be chosen by a panel of local judges. A new award this year, &quot;Most Money Raised&quot;, will be presented to the team who contributes the most financial support to the event.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased and honored to once again host Canstruction at the State Museum,&quot; said Mark Schaming, State Museum Director. &quot;Canstruction is fascinating to see, but most importantly, it provides support for vital community services. We invite the Capital Region to visit the State Museum during Canstruction and help make sure those in need in our community won't have to go hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are proud to bring Canstruction to the Capital Region showcasing the deep talent of local firms and students, and ultimately donating tens of thousands of cans of food to feed the hungry in our region,&quot; said Sara Stein, AIA, LEED AP, President of Capital Region Canstruction and Architect at EYP Architecture and Engineering.</p>
<p>Natasha Pernicka, Executive Director of The Food Pantries for the Capital District said, &quot;This magnificent event not only helps The Food Pantries infuse its member pantries with much needed food, it heightens the awareness of the need in our community. The local numbers are devastating &ndash; our Pantries in Albany, Rensselaer, and Saratoga Counties provided food for over 2.5 million meals in 2012, 200,000 more than 2011.  This event is one huge step forward for us to help alleviate hunger in our local community.&quot;</p>
<p>Capital Region Canstruction is supported by The American Institute of Architects' Eastern New York Chapter. This year's Canstruction is presented by Price Chopper with EYP Architecture &amp;  Engineering and media sponsor the Times Union. Gold sponsors include Zone 5, Key Bank, Camelot, A.W. Hastings &amp; Co., Harbrook and Mazzone Hospitality. Silver sponsors include Data Flow and CDPHP. </p>
