<title>STATE MUSEUM SCIENTISTS TO STUDY GLACIAL LAKES IN ESOPUS VALLEY</title>

<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; During the week of April 8th, New York  State Museum  geologists will collect sediment cores in the Esopus Valley  and its tributary valleys to conduct research relating to climate change and provide a unique educational experience to the Onteora High  School Earth Science students.</p>
<p>Students observing the research project will  have an opportunity to better understand glaciation, geologic time, rock and  mineral identification and how streams and rivers change the landscape. </p>
<p>The research project is funded by the  Ashokan Watershed Stream Management Program, a  partnership of Cornell Cooperative Extension in Ulster County,  the Ulster County Soil and Water Conservation District and the New York City  Department of Environmental Protection. It will involve mapping the  location and thickness of clay deposits in the Esopus Creek watershed. The clay was deposited in large lakes dammed  by glacial ice during the most recent retreat of the continental ice sheet from  New York State between 20,000 and 12,000 years  ago. During their existence, the glacial  lake basins accumulated thick deposits of layered silt and clay that record  information about climate change. Geologists hope to extract  paleo-climate data from the recovered sediments  to help determine the timing of the lakes' existence and the ice retreat. </p>
<p>The second, and more pragmatic reason  for locating the clay deposits in Esopus Creek watershed is because Esopus  Creek water flows into the Ashokan Reservoir, one of the Catskill water supply  reservoirs for New York City&rsquo;s  drinking water. Floods in the Esopus  watershed have caused stream bank erosion and landslides that expose these lake  clay sources and increase the amount of clay suspended in the water, causing turbidity. </p>
<p>Because of the importance of  identifying the distribution of these potential turbidity sources in the  Ashokan watershed, experts with the State Geological Survey of the New York  State Museum were funded in 2009 and 2010 by the National Cooperative  Geological Mapping Program of the </p>
<p>United States Geological Survey. Knowing the location and  extent of clay deposits will aid the Ashokan Watershed Stream Management  Program&rsquo;s proposed management strategies for improving the quality of New York City's drinking  water.</p>
<p>Established in 1836, the State Museum  is a program of the State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education.  Located on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on  Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further  information can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the Museum  website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
