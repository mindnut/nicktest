		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;">ALBANY, NY &ndash; &ldquo;Early settlers&rdquo; will be the theme of the New York State Museum&rsquo;s November </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">4-5 Family Fun Weekend, which will focus on the lives of New York&rsquo;s colonial settlers and the </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">soldiers who protected them. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> The program, which is presented free of charge, takes place from 1 to 4 p.m. both </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">days and will give young people a glimpse of the ways in which people endured harsh upstate </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0;">winters in the 18th century. Events take place in the Adirondack Hall on the Museum&rsquo;s first floor. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;"> Both afternoons, re-enactors from British Army units, which served in and around the Capital </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">Region during the French and Indian War, will be encamped, appearing as they might have </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">in 1758. They will play the role of two units -- the 55th Light Infantry and the Grenadiers of </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">the British Army. Commanded by Capt. Chris Cook of Springfield, MA, the soldiers of the 55th </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">will act out chores and drills and demonstrate how they made and used winter gear. These </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">soldiers protected settlers against raids by the French and Indians who were coming from the </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">North. Often their wives and children traveled with them. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal"> Wendy Nollner of the Museum&rsquo;s visitor services staff will demonstrate crafts of colonial </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">women. Children can also make their own crafts, including an old-fashioned sheep ornament.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">They can also make a spinning top, which was a favorite of children in that era. The Museum will </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal">also hold a scavenger hunt, with prizes, and give children an activity packet with games and </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0;">puzzles. </p>
