<p>ALBANY, NY - - Favorite nursery rhymes and children&rsquo;s songs, colored by jazz and the blues, will be
presented during two performances of the Mother Goose Jazz Band at the New York State Museum Saturday, November 26th at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. </p>
<p> The interactive performances introduce children, ages 2-10, to the world of jazz. But the music is 
designed for both young and adult audiences. Familiar children&rsquo;s songs have been set to the music of jazz 
greats Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins and Thelonious Monk. The performances provide a fun way to teach 
children about steady beat and syncopation, improvisation and the Afro-European roots of the blues. </p>
<p> Special guest vocalist Laurel Mass&eacute;, founding member of the Manhattan Transfer, will join the 
musicians. The band is directed by Josh Greenberg, a composer, educator and saxophonist whose jazz 
albums have won awards from the National Library Association, Parents&rsquo; Guide to Children&rsquo;s Media and 
Family Life magazine. The band also includes jazz musicians Gene Garone, Ryan Lucas, David Gleason, 
Ken Olsen and Cathy Olsen. A youth chorus of high school and college age girls round out the band. </p>
<p> The Mother Goose Jazz Band has been performing throughout the Northeast for the past 10 years, playing such venues as First Night New York City, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and the International Association of Jazz Educators National Conference. </p>
<p> Admission is $5 for children 12 and under, $7 for adults, and children under two are free. Tickets may be purchased the day of the performance.</p>
<p>The New York State Museum is located on Madison Avenue in Albany. Further information about programs and events can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at www.nysm.nysed.gov.</p>
