<p>(ALBANY,   NEW YORK) Abraham Lincoln scholar  Harold Holzer will present a lecture during the evening of Nov. 9 as part of an  event highlighting a two-day exhibition of Lincoln&rsquo;s  preliminary Emancipation Proclamation at the New York State   Museum. </p>
<p>Holzer will speak at 8  p.m. in the Huxley Theater about &ldquo;Lincoln and Liberty: Re-assessing the  Preliminary Proclamation in the Age of Spielberg.&rdquo; Author of the new book &ldquo;<em>Emancipating  Lincoln</em>,&rdquo; Holzer will explore the ever-changing reputation of Lincoln&rsquo;s  Emancipation Proclamation from controversial and revolutionary order, to  talismanic trophy, to maligned and misunderstood fraud &mdash; and back again to  icon. The talk will come at the moment of the release of Steven  Spielberg&rsquo;s movie, &ldquo;<em>Lincoln</em><em>,&rdquo; </em>which  explores Lincoln&rsquo;s  concurrent roles as politician, peacemaker, and liberator.</p>
<p>The Preliminary  Emancipation Proclamation will be on display in the Museum lobby on Nov.9-10 from  9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. as part of the exhibition entitled <em>The  First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. </em>The  preliminary Emancipation Proclamation is the only surviving version of the  document in Lincoln&rsquo;s  handwriting. The exhibition, which includes historical background and  interpretation of the document, marks the sesquicentennial of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation  and has traveled to eight other cities across New York state this fall. </p>
<p> A related exhibition, <em>An  Irrepressible Conflict: The Empire State in the Civil War</em>,  is open at the State   Museum through September  22, 2013 in Exhibition Hall. This 7,000-square foot exhibition commemorates the  150th anniversary of the Civil War and chronicles  the pivotal role New York   State played in the war. Support for this  exhibition is provided by RBC Wealth Management. </p>
<p>&ldquo;To hear Harold Holzer speak is to be  in the presence of Abraham Lincoln,&rdquo; said State Museum Director Mark Schaming.  &ldquo;His programs about Lincoln are incredibly  enlightening as he brings the history of Lincoln  to life. We are thrilled to have Harold Holzer at the State  Museum at a time when we are reflecting  on Lincoln, the  Emancipation Proclamation and how he is understood today.&rdquo; </p>
<p>  Holzer is the  past co-chairman of the U. S. Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, chairman  of the succeeding Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation, and the author,  co-author, or editor of 42 books on Lincoln  and the Civil War era. During the past  35 years, Holzer has also written more than 500 articles for both scholarly and  popular publications, and has contributed chapters to 30 additional books. He appears frequently on C-SPAN, PBS, the  History Channel, and other television networks.  A former journalist and political and government press secretary, Holzer  has served as a senior executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1992,  currently as senior vice president for government relations and public affairs. </p>
