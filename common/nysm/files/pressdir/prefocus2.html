<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - <em>Focus on Nature VI: Natural History Illustration,</em> blends art and science by showcasing the work of science and natural history illustrators. The exhibition is on display from <strong>April 26 through July 30</strong> in the New York State Museum's Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>Featuring 85 works from 61 artists, this juried exhibition features representatives from the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators and the American Society of Botanical Artists. This year it coincides with and nicely complements another annual museum event, the New York State Natural History Conference, held from <strong>April 26-29.</strong></p> 
<p>Curated by Patricia Kernan, the museum's scientific illustrator, the exhibition features mammals, insects, flowers and other specimens important to scientific research in pen, ink, watercolor and other mediums. Kernan sometimes spends hours observing a specimen through a microscope just to get all of the details perfect.</p>
<p>Kernan's precise illustrations have graced the pages of many studies and publications produced by the State Museum. Working within the confines of exact measurements and scientific accuracy, Kernan says she strives to make her drawings as aesthetically pleasing as possible. In fact, the illustrations displayed in the exhibit do much to elucidate our knowledge of science, but can also be appreciated as works of art.</p>
<p>Three workshops by scientific illustrators will be held in conjunction with the exhibit and the Natural History Conference. They are open to the public at the Museum.</p>
