<p>The sixth annual exhibition, open through September 1, contains art works from 24 SUNY campuses. It is a juried show featuring more than 60 works of art selected from more than 200 artistic pieces submitted to the SUNY student art exhibition at the State university Plaza this past academic year. The works for the fall 2007 and spring shows were chosen by individual art departments across SUNY&rsquo;s 64 campuses. The traditional areas of drawing, ceramics, painting, printmaking, photography and sculpture are enhanced by the addition of digital imaging and mixed media installations. </p>
