<title>BIRDS OF NEW YORK OPENS JAN. 30 AT NEW YORK STATE MUSEUM</title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; <em>Birds of New York and the Paintings of Louis Agassiz Fuertes</em> opens  at the New York State  Museum January 30, showcasing the  original watercolors painted a century ago by one of America&rsquo;s foremost science artists.</p>
<p> The exhibition, in the Museum&rsquo;s  Crossroads Gallery, will be open through September 6. It will feature 40 of more than 100 paintings  that Fuertes created to illustrate <em>Birds  of New York</em>, a monumental book that combined beautiful art and scientific  scholarship. The first edition of the book will be on display, along with a  print portfolio and specimens from the Museum&rsquo;s ornithology collection. </p>
<p>The  first volume of <em>Birds of New York &ndash; Water  Birds and Game Birds</em> &ndash; was published to much acclaim in 1910. Volume Two &ndash; <em>Land Birds</em> &ndash; followed four years later. <em>Birds of New York</em> was collaboration  between Fuertes and author Elon Howard Eaton and served as a model for  ornithology books that followed. Fuertes&rsquo; watercolors celebrated the beauty of  wild birds, while Eaton advocated for the stewardship and conservation of birds  and their habitats. Produced by the State  Museum and published by the University  of the State of New York, the book inspired  the citizens of New York  to observe and care for the state&rsquo;s birds. </p>
<p>The  book was commissioned by former State Museum Director John Mason Clarke, who  served from 1904 to 1925. When he began his tenure it had been 60 years since  the last book on the state&rsquo;s birds had been published, and he wanted a new  study that would update scientific knowledge. He commissioned Eaton, a biology  teacher in Rochester,  to research and write the book. Eaton enlisted Fuertes, a famous bird artist  from Ithaca, to  provide the illustrations. </p>
<p>Clarke&rsquo;s  written correspondence with Eaton and Fuertes, preserved in the New York State  Archives, reveals that Clarke was a guiding force in producing the book,  sometimes attending to even small details.</p>
<p>Named  for the naturalist Louis Agassiz, Fuertes&rsquo; interest in the natural world was  encouraged and he began to draw birds at an early age. He attended Cornell University  in Ithaca.  While still a student, Fuertes met a prominent Smithsonian ornithologist who recognized  and promoted his artistic talent. This helped launch an active career and,  soon, he was considered to be the leading bird artist of his day. </p>
<p>Just  as John James Audubon inspired bird painters in the early 1800s, Fuertes  influenced artists a century later by skillfully capturing the lifelike poses  and natural settings of birds. Roger Tory Peterson, an avian artist and author  of well-known field guides, wrote that while Audubon was famous for his  dramatic compositions Fuertes &ldquo;caught more of the character of the bird  itself.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Eaton also was a lifelong student of  natural history. As a young man he prepared bird mounts and studied skins after  enrolling in a taxidermy course. He established the Department of Biology at Hobart College  in Geneva,  where he taught from 1908 until his death in 1934. In 1901 he became known  statewide when the Rochester Academy of Science published a paper he had  written on the birds of western New    York. </p>
<p> The lasting scientific importance of <em>Birds of New York</em> stems from Eaton&rsquo;s  authoritative compilation of original research that is included in the book,  such as distribution maps, migration surveys and detailed observations of  nests, eggs, songs and behaviors. The book continues to be cited by  ornithologists studying changes in bird abundance and distribution since that  time. </p>
<p>It also has strengthened interest in the study  and protection of birds, and spurred the formation of local birding clubs and  bird sanctuaries. Sixteen thousand  copies of a print portfolio, including all of the color illustrations in the book,  were widely distributed and inspired &ldquo;Bird Day&rdquo; celebrations across the state.</p>
<p>The State   Museum will sponsor a  free program in connection with the exhibition. Creative Art Day will be held  Sunday, March 28 from 1 to 3 p.m.<strong> </strong>Families will be invited to participate in artful activities  based on the exhibition.
