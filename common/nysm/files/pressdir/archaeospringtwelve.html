<p>ALBANY &ndash; Research findings on a  200-300-year-old skull found in a wall in Coeymans &ndash; the subject of recent news  accounts &ndash; will be one of the topics discussed during a series of free weekly  lectures on &ldquo;Research in Archaeology&rdquo; at the New York State   Museum. </p>
<p> The five lectures will be held every  Wednesday through March 28 at 12:10 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. Lecture topics and dates are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>February       29 &ndash; &ldquo;The Archaeology of Eurocentrism.&rdquo; Historical archaeologists study       the role of Europeans in post-1500 history, but sometimes this research is       labeled Eurocentric. Dr. Charles Orser, curator of Historical Archaeology,       will address the problems of adopting a purely emotional view of       Eurocentrism and argue instead for its examination.</li>
  <li>March       7 &ndash;<strong> &ldquo;</strong>Preserve, Protect,       Document: Archaeology of the Bailey Site, Onondaga County, New York&rdquo; The       State Museum's Cultural Resource Survey Program assists state and federal       agencies in meeting their historic preservation mandates by documenting       and preserving cultural remains before they are lost through construction.       State Archaeologist Dr. Christina Rieth will discuss the Bailey site and       stewardship activities carried out at this 15th-century       horticultural hamlet. </li>
  <li>March       14 &ndash; &ldquo;Learning from Pottery.&rdquo; Broken pieces of pottery, or sherds, are one       of the most common artifacts recovered from archaeological sites younger       than 3,000 years old. Dr. John P. Hart, director of the State Museum&rsquo;s       Research &amp; Collections division, will discuss recently completed       research on sherds that provides information on how Native Americans       interacted across what is now New         York state.</li>
  <li>March       21 &ndash; &ldquo;The Skull in the Wall: The Case of the Coeymans Lady.&rdquo; The discovery       of a human skull during repairs to the stone foundation at the historic       Coeymans House in southern Albany        County raised many       questions about the person&rsquo;s identity and manner of death. Lisa Anderson,       curator of bioarchaeology, will take a closer look at the skeletal       evidence and historical context of the case. </li>
  <li>March       28 &ndash; &ldquo;Cache and Carry: New Insights on Ice Age Technology of New York       Paleoindians.&rdquo; New York's       first people colonized the state at the end of the Ice Age. Ranging widely across New York and beyond, many have wondered       how these hunter gatherers created a portable stone technology compatible       with their mobile way of life. Dr. Jonathan Lothrop, curator of       archaeology, describes new insights from the study of a Paleoindian stone       tool cache discovered in the upper Susquehanna Valley.</li>
</ul>
