<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Biodiversity Research Institute  (BRI) and the New York State Museum  will present weekly lectures in October focusing on recent biodiversity  research, conservation and education initiatives in New York State. </p>
<p> All lectures are free and will be held on  Wednesdays at noon in the Huxley Theater. The lecturers will focus on the  results of research that was funded by the New York State Biodiversity Research  Institute. Lecture topics and  dates are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>October       8 &ndash; &ldquo;Double-crested Cormorants: Potential Impacts on Biodiversity in the New York Harbor.&rdquo; Twenty years ago,       approximately 1,000 breeding pairs of Double-crested Cormorants (<em>Phalacrocorax auritus</em>) were       documented on two islands in the New York Harbor;       now there are approximately 1,300 pairs nesting on seven islands. Dr.       Susan Elbin, director of conservation for New York Audubon, will present       research on this population, assessing its impact on biodiversity in the harbor.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>October       15 &ndash; &ldquo;Treatment of Invasive Plant Infestations: Assessments of Three       Species in the Adirondack        Park.&rdquo; The       Adirondack Park Invasive Plant program manages invasive plant species just       taking a hold in the Park, to benefit natural communities. Ray Curran,       independent consulting ecologist with the Adirondack Nature Conservancy, will       discuss current research on the effectiveness of several techniques to       control Japanese knotweed (<em>Fallopia       japonica</em>), common reed grass (<em>Phragmites       australis</em>), and yellow iris (<em>Iris       pseudacorus</em>).</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>October       22 &ndash; &ldquo;Conserving Barrens Buck Moth in Pine Barrens       Habitats.&rdquo; Dr. Dylan Parry, associate professor at SUNY College of       Environmental Science and Forestry, will discuss how prescribed burning in       the Albany Pine Bush Preserve has enhanced habitat for the barrens buck moth       (<em>Hemileuca maia</em>). He will examine       the role of natural enemies in population declines, citing an introduced       insect parasitoid that has decimated species closely related to the       barrens buck moth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>October       29 &ndash; &ldquo;Confronting Biological Invasions: A Growing Environmental Problem.&rdquo; Introduced       invasive species have transformed most ecosystems and more problematic       species are on the way. Dr. David Strayer, of the Cary Institute of       Ecosystem Studies, will review the history and impact of a few prominent       invaders, the extent and causes of these introductions, and proposed elements       of a solution to this escalating problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The New  York State Legislature created the Biodiversity Research Institute in 1993 to help  meet the challenges associated with preserving the state&rsquo;s biodiversity. The BRI serves as a comprehensive source  of information, which is used to advise  both public and private agencies on matters relating to the status of New York&rsquo;s biological  resources. Housed within the New York State Museum,  the BRI is funded through the Environmental Protection Fund. The BRI includes several collaborators,  including the State Museum, the New York Natural Heritage Program,  Audubon New York, the state Department of  Environmental Conservation, New York,  Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and The Nature  Conservancy. Further information is  available at: <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri/">http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri/</a> or by calling (518) 474-6531. </p>
<p> The New York State Museum  is a cultural program of the New York State Education Department. Founded in  1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history  research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is  open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New  Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be obtained by calling  (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
