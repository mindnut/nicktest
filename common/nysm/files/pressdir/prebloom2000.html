<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - Despite what the groundhog says, spring is just around the corner at the New York State Museum. <em>New York in Bloom</em> will be held from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Friday, Feb. 25, through Sunday, Feb. 27.</p>
<p>The flower show is the main fundraiser for the Museum's after-school programs for city youth, the Museum Club and its teen extension, the Discovery Squad. <em>New York in Bloom</em> features about 60 local exhibitors, including many professional floral designers. During <em>New York in Bloom</em>, the Museum charges $2 per person (children 12 and under are free).</p>
<p>The main theme of the flower show will be Asian-influenced floral and garden design. Museum Club and Discovery Squad members, with help from Faddegon's Nursery, will create a lush Asian garden in the Museum's main lobby. Included will be replicable walkways, origami cranes, rice terraces and stone ruins.</p>
<p>"For more than a decade, the Museum's outstanding after-school programs have provided a very important resource for our young people. <em>New York in Bloom</em> provides vital funding for these programs," Museum Institute Executive Director Laurie L. Roberts said.</p>
<p>Serving as honorary chairwoman this year will be Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<p>"Education must continue well after the typical school day ends. The structured environment of the Museum Club and Discovery Squad programs lead to success within and beyond the academic confines," Dr. Jackson said.</p>
<p>In addition to the floral displays, several special events are planned. A Preview Gala Reception will be held on Thursday, Feb. 24 at 6:30 p.m., honoring Jack Faddegon, an avid supporter of both the Museum and <em>New York in Bloom.</em> Tickets for the gala are available at the Benefactor Level for $80, the Supporter Level for $60, or the Junior Level (age 35 or younger) for $40.</p>
<p>A flower-arranging demonstration will begin at 10:30 a.m., followed by a luncheon on Saturday, Feb. 26, and will feature the Asian-influenced arranging techniques of John Haines, who will be available to sign copies of his books. The $40 fee for this event includes admission to the demonstration, a gourmet luncheon catered by Yono Purnomo, valet parking and admission to New York in Bloom. For more information or to reserve tickets to these events, please call 518/474-5801.</p>
<p>Other activities throughout the weekend include: floral painting and drawing for kids, table setting demonstrations, a talk on the history of tulips in Albany and exhibit tours of Treasures from the <em>Wunsch Americana Foundation and The Weitsman Stoneware Collection.</em></p>
<p>The Museum Club and the Discovery Squad includes about 75 youths, who meet during the after-school hours, often cited as the times children are most at risk. They help develop academic and cultural activities that link Museum exhibits to curriculum, current events and social issues. There are tutors available for homework, and to help improve math and reading skills - which helps fulfill goals of the State Education Department.</p>
<p>The teen extension of the Museum Club, the Discovery Squad, works throughout the Museum with mentors to learn job skills and knowledge of the workforce.</p>
