<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Museum will host free lectures in March on historical archaeology and African-American history and also offer an encore presentation of two popular lectures on &ldquo;Global Warming&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peak Oil.&rdquo;<br />
State Museum Geologist Dr.Taury Smith, curator of oil and gas, will present &ldquo;Global Warming &ndash; What Can Be Done to Stop It&rdquo; on Thursday, March 1 at noon in the Carole F. Huxley Theater. Most scientists agree that the earth is warming and that the burning of fossil fuels has been a major contributor to that warming. Smith will review the possible consequences of further warming and what needs to be done to slow or stop it, including significantly reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.<br />
On Thursday, March 8 at noon in the Huxley Theater, Smith will present a lecture on &ldquo;Peak Oil.&rdquo; Several recent studies suggest that world oil production will peak in the near future and start to decline, possibly leading to a worldwide economic catastrophe. Smith will discuss the past, present and future of oil production, the concept of peak oil and the issues surrounding this controversial topic.<br />
Jennifer Lemak, an African-American historian and curator at the State Museum, will present a lecture on &ldquo;The Rise and Fall of Marcus Garvey&rdquo; on Tuesday, March 13 at 7 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. Lemak will also provide an artifact tour on Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association.<br />
