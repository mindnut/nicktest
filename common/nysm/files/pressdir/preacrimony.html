<title>Acrimony in Albany: The Foster-Hall Geological Chart Controversy</title>

<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - America's first legal battle over science took place in New York's capital from 1849 to 1851. The issue was over a geological chart created by James T. Foster, a local schoolteacher, which claimed to accurately depict a vertical slice of the earth.</p>
<p>But State Paleontologist James Hall perceived the chart as a personal and professional affront. He denounced Foster's chart and designed his own in retaliation.</p>
<p>The beautifully lithographed charts, along with the papers documenting the ensuing legal battle will be on display at the New York State Museum from Friday, Feb. 18 to April 30 in the West Hall. Scientific papers, fossils and lithography stones are also among the items that will be in the exhibit. </p>
<p>The charts were carefully conserved and are owned by the New York State Archives and the New York State Library, which along with the State Museum, are programs of the State Education Department. The charts feature intricate lithographs of prehistoric scenes. Paleontology Collections Manager Linda Van Aller Hernick curated the exhibit and researched the fascinating court case.</p>
<p>It all started when Foster, who was not a geologist, created a chart he intended to have used in New York State's public schools. However, Albany was the center of geologic research 
in America at the time, and Hall was the science's primary authority.</p>
<p>With the help of acclaimed Harvard University zoologist Louis Agassiz, one of the country's most eminent geologists, Hall publicly denounced Foster's chart and designed his own chart.</p>
<p>Agassiz called Foster's chart a "monstrous map," declaring that "its mere circulation would be considered abroad as a disgrace to American geologists ..." Hall published a critical letter by Agassiz, as well as one of his own, in the Albany newspapers.</p>
<p>Foster, saying he was "greatly injured in his good name," subsequently sued both Agassiz and Hall for libel, demanding $20,000 and $40,000, respectively, in damages.</p>
<p>It is even believed that just before the trial, Hall learned that a shipment of maps were heading to New York City on a Hudson River night boat. It is reputed that Hall booked himself on the same boat, found the maps and threw them overboard.</p>
<p>The defense brought in other eminent 19th century geologists and they handily defeated Foster, who left Albany in disgrace. The trial was the focus of national and international attention, raising numerous issues. Clearly there was a need to establish a system of review and criticism to prevent the distribution of inaccurate information by amateurs. </p>
