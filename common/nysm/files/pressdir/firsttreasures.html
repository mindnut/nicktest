<div id="main"> 
<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A rare display of Revolutionary War-era artifacts, recently on exhibit at the State Capitol, will be open to the public again on Friday evening, August 3 as part of the New York State Museum&rsquo;s 1st Friday event.</p>
<p><br />
    Freedom&rsquo;s Treasures,&rdquo; open from 5 to 9 p.m. at the State Museum, features a collection from the New York State Library, Archives and Museum of some of New York&rsquo;s most important Revolutionary War-era artifacts that have rarely been seen by the public. The same exhibition was on display at the State Capitol from July 4-6. </p>
<p><br />
    The exhibition includes an original draft of George Washington&rsquo;s Farewell Address, penned in his hand, which was sent to Alexander Hamilton for comment and revision on May 15, 1796. The document is part of the George Washington Collection at the New York State Library and was rescued from the fire that ravaged the State Capitol in 1911. </p>
<p><br />
&ldquo;Freedom&rsquo;s Treasures&rdquo; also will give the public the chance to see a pistol that was given to President Washington by the Marquis de Lafayette and one of General Washington&rsquo;s dress swords. According to Washington family tradition, the sword was presented to Washington by Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. The sword was purchased by the State of New York directly from Washington&rsquo;s family in 1871 and is depicted in the Washington portrait that hangs in the United States House of Representatives. </p>
<p><br />
    Among the other artifacts included in this exhibition are a portrait of Governor DeWitt Clinton and a writing desk he used. The exhibition also includes the original engrossed (large print) copy of the U.S. Constitution sent to New York State for ratification and the &ldquo;spy papers&rdquo; retrieved from British Major John Andre´&rsquo;s boot that implicated American General Benedict Arnold in the West Point conspiracy. There also is a print of Andre´ crossing the Hudson River (based upon his own drawing of the event). <br />
    <br />
    Also featured is a bronze bust of George Washington and Washington&rsquo;s copy of &ldquo;A Representation of the Cloathing of His Majesty&rsquo;s Household and of all the Forces upon the Establishments of Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; (the uniform book).</p>
<p> <br />
    The 1st Friday event is free and will include complimentary refreshments. Parking is available in lots on both sides of the Museum and visitors can also ride the Albany City Trolley www.Albany.org to and from the Museum. Many participating galleries, shops and eateries line the route. </p>
<p><br />
    Each first Friday of the month Albany&rsquo;s premier art institutions and galleries &ndash; from uptown to downtown, with Center Square in between &ndash; open their doors to the public, showcasing current exhibitions and collections.</p>
