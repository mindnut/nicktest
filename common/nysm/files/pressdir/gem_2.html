<p>A lecture and book signing by a Smithsonian paleontologist will be among the activities at the "<em>10th Annual James Campbell Memorial Gem, Mineral and Fossil Show and Sale</em>," which will be held Saturday, February 22 and Sunday, February 23 at the New York State Museum. </p>
<p>Open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the museum's concourse level, the show will help to fund new acquisitions for the museum's gem and mineral collections. It will feature vendors, who will display and sell gems, jewelry, minerals, fossils, books, videos, lapidary equipment and supplies, stone carvings, bookends and silver and goldsmithing tools. </p>
<p>Available for sale at the museum's publications booth will be publications produced by the New York State Museum's Research and Collections Division documenting research in natural and human history in New York. Materials on display will include data in geology, archaeology, paleontology, anthropology, biology, and history. </p>
<p>Dr. Ellis Yochelson, who also is retired from the US Geological Survey, will lecture Saturday at 2 p.m. in the Clark Auditorium on "Mystery Fossils: 500 Million-Year-old 'Motor-Cycle Tracks' from Northeastern New York." His lecture on Sunday at noon in the Clark Auditorium will be on "A Life Well Lived: The Utica and Albany Years of C.D. Walcott, America's Greatest Geologist." </p>
<p>The Saturday lecture will focus on Dr. Yochelson's research with Michael Fedonkin of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This work led to a new interpretation of how large marine animals produced giant track-ways in ancient sandstones near the New York-Canadian border.</p>
<p>Dr. Yochelson's lecture on Walcott will begin with Walcott's birth near Utica and trace his career in geologica research that led to his becoming head of the Smithsonian and a member of the American Academy of Sciences. Dr. Yochelson will also sign copies of his biography on Walcott.
On Saturday at noon in the Clark Auditorium, Dr. Marian Lupulescu, a mineralogist for the State 
Museum, will lecture on "The World of Minerals." He will explain what a mineral is, the relationship between its structure, shape and properties, and in what environments minerals can form. Minerals from
the museum's extensive collections will be shown as examples.</p>
<p>Other activities over the weekend will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mineral dig for children hosted by the Capital District Mineral Club throughout the weekend.</li>
<li>A continuous presentation by John Skiba, the museum's senior cartographer, about map making processes and methods for producing the State Museum's new geologic quadrangle map.</li>
<li>Guided tours of the Minerals of New York gallery, highlighting recent acquisitions, by Michael Hawkins, the State Museum's mineralogy collections manager, on Saturday at 1 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Meet in museum lobby</li>
