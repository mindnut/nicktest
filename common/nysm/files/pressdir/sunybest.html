<p>ALBANY &ndash; The annual Best of SUNY Student Art Exhibition returns to the New York State Museum Saturday, May 19 showcasing the work of SUNY&rsquo;s top student artists from across the state. <br />
  The fifth annual exhibition features 75 works of art selected by a panel of jurors from more than 200 pieces displayed in the fall 2006 and spring 2007 student art exhibitions held at the State University Plaza in downtown Albany. The traditional areas of drawing, ceramics, painting, printmaking, and photography are enhanced by the addition of digital imaging and mixed media installations. This year&rsquo;s exhibition, open through September 3, contains art works from 28 SUNY campuses.<br />
 &ldquo;We are pleased to have the opportunity to exhibit these outstanding works of art from one of our fellow University of the State of New York institutions,&rdquo; said State Museum Director Dr. Clifford Siegfried. &ldquo;Our hope is that collaborations of this kind, recognizing the achievements of students from throughout the SUNY system, will strengthen education in New York State and inspire other talented students in the future.&rdquo;<br />
 &quot;We are very grateful the New York State Museum has agreed to host the SUNY student exhibition again this year,&quot; said SUNY Chancellor John R. Ryan. &quot;SUNY takes great pride in knowing that visitors to the State Museum will take in some of the very best SUNY student art work for the duration of the summer. The continuing support of the State Museum speaks volumes about the high quality of the artwork so many talented SUNY students create.&quot;<br />
Three student artists in the Best of SUNY Student Art Exhibition will receive &ldquo;Best in Show&rdquo; awards of $1,000. &ldquo;Honorable Mention&rdquo; awards of $500 will be given to three other students. Judging for these awards is arranged by Richard Schwartz, chairman of the New York State Council of the Arts.<br />
