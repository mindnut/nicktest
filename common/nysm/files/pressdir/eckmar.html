<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; The first exhibition of its kind -- &ldquo;<em>The  Landscape of Memory: Prints by Frank C. Eckmair</em>&rdquo; -- opens at the New York State Museum  November 19 showcasing the works of one of the nation&rsquo;s most accomplished  printmakers.</p>
<p> Open until  September 18, 2011 in Crossroads Gallery, the exhibition comes from the  Museum&rsquo;s own 386-piece collection, which is the largest museum collection of  Eckmair&rsquo;s works that exists. The Museum&rsquo;s curatorial and exhibition team worked  with Eckmair during the last few years to archive his lifework, document the  way he makes the prints and develop the exhibition. </p>
<p>The exhibition features more than 80  works, mostly landscapes, which include framed  woodcut prints, as well as wood engravings, sculptures and the original  woodblocks that track Eckmair&rsquo;s career as an artist and lifelong resident of  Gilbertsville in central New York.  Also included are wood engraving tools and an early 20th-century  Poco Proof printing press, on loan from Eckmair.</p>
<p>While growing up in central New York,  Eckmair developed an affinity for the quiet landscape of the rural areas of  that part of the state. His subjects are its<strong> </strong>farm fields, stone walls, abandoned homes, and old barns. </p>
<p>Although he did all kinds of  printmaking Eckmair preferred woodcuts, noting that &ldquo;wood is a poor man&rsquo;s  material.&rdquo; </p>
<p> During the 1950s,  printmaking grew in stature in New York with  the rise of the New York   School, a group of  artists, poets, and musicians centered in the city. On Long   Island, the influential Universal Limited Art Editions studio encouraged  collaborations between artists and writers, provided printmaking space, and brought prints to collectors,  galleries, and museums. Finally, the explosive growth of State University of  New York campuses during the postwar period led to  the establishment of major printmaking programs that are still operating today. </p>
<p> Born in 1930, Eckmair spent his early  years drawing and working at his father&rsquo;s hotel in Gilbertsville, a small  village in Otsego County, west of Cooperstown.  He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the State University of Iowa, where he  studied with Mauricio Lasansky, who is considered to be the &ldquo;father of 20th-century  American printmaking.&rdquo; After teaching public school, Eckmair served in the U.S.  Air Force in Korea, Japan, and the northwestern United States.  He then received a Master of Fine Arts in printmaking from Ohio University.  From 1963 to 1995 he was a key figure in the print studio of Buffalo State  College, where he was a revered professor and influenced a generation of  artists. While working in Buffalo,  he maintained his family residence in Gilbertsville.</p>
<p>Eckmair&rsquo;s work received its earliest  recognition through American Associated Artists (AAA), a program founded to  market affordable fine art prints to the American public. Like earlier artists  such as Grant Wood, John Steuart Curry, and Thomas Hart Benton, Eckmair created  prints of regional landscapes for AAA that had great populist appeal.  Considered a master of the woodcut and represented in major collections around  the world, Eckmair continues to create haunting works evoking rural life in  upstate New York.  He is the artistic director of Birch Book Press, a publisher of hand-crafted  letterpress books and art.<strong></strong></p>
