<title>NYS MUSEUM SCIENTIST, ONLY U.S. RESEARCHER SELECTED</title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, N.Y.  &ndash; A New York State Museum  paleontologist has become the only scientist in the U.S.  selected to participate in an all-expense paid research program in Spain  that will enable him to investigate the effects of climate change on mammals  over the last 2 million years. </p>
<p> Dr. Robert Feranec, the Museum&rsquo;s  curator of vertebrate paleontology, will work with Dr. Nuria Garcia from the  Department of Paleontology at the University at Madrid. The three-month research project,  and all expenses associated with it, are totally funded through the Program of  Distinguished Visiting Foreign Investigators at the Complutense University of  Madrid. Feranec&rsquo;s selection is a rare honor since historically, most scientists  chosen to participate in this program are within the European Union.</p>
<p>During the research  stay Feranec will help excavate a cave for vertebrate fossils in Madrid.He will  also visit numerous museums collecting data to conduct analyses. </p>
<p>The data from this extended research stay will be critical to  Feranec&rsquo;s research in New York   State for several reasons.  The Pleistocene vertebrate paleontological record in Spain  is significantly greater than what exists in New York. Many of the fossils that Feranec  will examine in Spain  will come from caves, and the extensive Spanish fossil record will allow him to  put the fossils in the State Museums collections (also mostly from caves) into  both an ecological and evolutionary context. For example, he will be able  to study and analyze ancestral species related to the Cohoes Mastodon and  mammoths.</p>
<p>Spain also offers Feranec the  opportunity to explore the effects of humans and climate change on animals, an  increasingly important topic. Humans have existed in Spain and interacted with animals for 1.8  million years as opposed to New York  where the record is only 13,000 years. Analyses of the Spanish fossils will  allow Feranec to compare and contrast what happens to animals with global  warming in the presence of humans (data from Spain), and what happens when  humans are not present (data from NY).</p>
<p>Also, Feranec will have a unique opportunity to study fossils that  come from United Nations designated  World Heritage Sites. During his museum visits, he will be able to see  the techniques that museums in Spain  use to curate and manage the extremely rare and important fossils in their  care. He can then use this knowledge to better curate and maintain the  fossil collections at the State   Museum. </p>
<p> In 2007, Feranec oversaw the conservation  of the Cohoes Mastodon, the reconstruction of its frame, and its relocation  from the State Museum lobby window to its new location  in the Museum&rsquo;s Exhibition Hall. The iconic Museum treasure is now the  centerpiece of an expanded exhibition, which Feranec collaborated on. </p>
<p>Feranec  joined the Museum staff in 2006. Prior to that, he had a two-year post-doctoral  fellowship at Stanford University and was a part-time teacher at Contra Costa  College, in Richmond, California.  In addition to his research in New York  State, he also has conducted field  work several times in Spain,  as well as in Colorado, Wyoming,  Idaho, Nevada,  and California.  He has a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in biology and geology from Syracuse  University, a master&rsquo;s degree in  Geological Sciences from the University  of Florida and a doctorate in  Integrative Biology from the University  of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p> The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Founded  in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural  history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison  Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be  obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
