<p>(ALBANY,   NEW YORK) <em>Focus on Nature XII: Natural History Illustration</em> opens April 28 at the New York State  Museum, showcasing juried artwork by  top illustrators from 15 countries, including some from the Capital District  and Hudson Valley. </p>
<p>The local artists include James Gurney of Rhinebeck, the author  and illustrator of the book series &ldquo;Dinotopia,&rdquo; which has appeared in 18  languages in more than 30 countries and sold two million copies. There also are  illustrations by Sue Adair of Schenectady,  David Wheeler of Mechanicville and Carol Woodin of Accord. </p>
<p>Open through December 31, 2012 in the Photography Gallery, this  biennial juried exhibition has continued to grow over the past 24 years, both  in scope and reputation. This year&rsquo;s exhibition features 93 natural history  illustrations, representing the work of 72 illustrators. These were selected  from 503 entries, submitted by 219 artists, up from the 450 submissions by 186 artists  in 2010. Approximately one-third of the artists whose work was selected were  new to the entry process. Countries represented for the first time are Thailand, Germany,  and Switzerland.  Other artists participating are from Australia,  Brazil, Canada, Colombia,  England, Italy, Japan,  The Netherlands, South Korea,  Spain, Portugal, and the USA.</p>
<p>The exhibition&rsquo;s goals are to demonstrate the important role  illustration has in natural science research and education, to stimulate  curiosity about the world, and to bring clearly into focus images of nature  that people might not otherwise be able to visualize. Many of the illustrations  are created for field guides, textbooks, science articles and presentations.</p>
<p>The subjects represented in the exhibition are diverse, ranging  from those only found in the artists&rsquo; home country to those that have a  worldwide distribution. These include many animals familiar in New York State  and the northeastern U.S.  such as the Great Horned Owl, Eastern Chipmunk, Woodchuck, and many that live underwater in the Long  Island Sound. There are illustrations of seaslugs, a Common Raven, and common  garden plants, such as garlic and chard. Also included are the Eastern Pygmy  Possum, the Dusky Moorhen, and the Brush-tailed  Rock-wallaby, all mammals found only in Australia, and the Papagaios, a parrot found in certain parts of Brazil. There also is an  Illuminated  Netdevil -- fierce looking, but only 3-inches-long. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>Focus on Nature XII</em> exhibition is like no other in the world,&rdquo; said  Mark Schaming, director of the State   Museum. &ldquo;It continues a  long New York State tradition of presenting  cutting-edge illustrations that reflect the latest knowledge of natural  history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natural history illustration is a field that requires keeping  pace with changing technology, and knowledge, and <em>Focus on Nature</em> has evolved to reflect these changes&rdquo; said Patricia  Kernan, scientific illustrator at the Museum and exhibition organizer. &ldquo;This  year&rsquo;s exhibition includes both digital and traditional illustrations. Whatever technique is  used, the aim is for accuracy and clarity to communicate the result of natural  history investigations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A five-member jury of artists and scientists selected the pieces  on display, based on each of the illustration&rsquo;s educational value and artistic  quality. Jury Awards will recognize the outstanding achievement of these  artists. </p>
