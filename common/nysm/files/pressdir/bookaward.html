<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; The Society for American Archaeology (SAA) has presented its 2008 Book Award to &ldquo;Before Albany: An Archaeology of Native-Dutch Relations in the Capital Region, 1600-1664,&rsquo;&rsquo; a volume published by the New York State Museum that examines relationships between Native Americans and Dutch settlers during this period. </p>
<p> The SAA presented the award March 28 to the book&rsquo;s author, Museum Research Associate Dr. James W. Bradley, at its annual meeting held in Vancouver, B.C. The book won in the Public Audience category, and was recognized for its use of archaeology to bring to light a &ldquo;brief but pivotal&rdquo; period of New York history. </p>
<p> &ldquo;This volume epitomizes what a book written and designed for the public should achieve,&rsquo;&rsquo; SAA said in bestowing the award. &ldquo;Bradley is to be congratulated for presenting a model for a popular book that does not talk down to its audience, and tells an engaging and interesting story. Albany has been privileged to have its history (including its material culture) presented in such an exceptional format.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Published last year, &ldquo;Before Albany&rdquo; reveals the stories behind the combs, pipes, plates, axes and beads uncovered in digs at the colonial settlement known as Beverwijck now Albany. The book recounts a 60-year period in which Dutch traders and Mohawks and Mahicans lived near one another and engaged in robust commerce. The author has said that Albany can take pride in a chapter of history that contrasts with the many examples elsewhere of Europeans taking land and forcing Native Americans out. He argues that the mutual respect between the Native people and the Dutch influenced how the Capital Region was settled.</p>
<p> &ldquo;This not just secondary research,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Dr. John P. Hart, director of Museum Research &amp;Collections, who nominated the book for the award. &ldquo;Dr. Bradley did a lot of primary research and created new knowledge about the past. The book demonstrates the importance of our archaeological collections as documents of New York&rsquo;s early European history.&rdquo;</p>
<p> A prominent archaeologist who is based in Boston, Bradley spent four years studying Museum artifacts and documents and consulting with Museum archaeological researchers and curators. The book is widely illustrated with artifacts from Museum collections. </p>
<p> Bradley, who grew up in Central New York, is a former director of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology in Andover, Mass. He has served on the Massachusetts Historic Commission and the National Park Service. Among other things he has worked on repatriating Native American remains. </p>
<p> Based in Washington, D.C., the Society for American Archaeology has more than 7,000 members and is the leading professional society of its kind in North America.</p>
