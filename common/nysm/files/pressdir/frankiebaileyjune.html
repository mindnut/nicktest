		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">ALBANY, NY &ndash; Dr. Frankie Bailey will speak about &ldquo;Crime in the Big Apple: The Social History of Crime in New York City&rdquo; on Saturday, June 3 at 2 p.m. in the State Museum Theater.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Dr. Bailey will examine how social changes have shaped New York City and how this social history is reflected in the crimes that have occurred there in the past 300 years. A professor of criminal justice at the University at Albany, Dr. Bailey is the co-author of several academic books including &ldquo;Law Never Here&rdquo;: A Social History of African American Responses to Issues of Crime and Justice with Alice Green, and Blood on Her Hands: The Social Construction of Women, Sexuality, and Murder with Donna Hale. She and Steven Chermak are the co-editors of a five volume set, Famous American Crimes and Trials (2004), which was nominated for the Anthony and Macavity awards. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">A native of Virginia, Dr. Bailey graduated from Virginia Tech, majoring in psychology and English, and obtained her doctorate in criminal justice from the University at Albany. The research for one of her early books -- Out of the Woodpile: Black Characters in Crime and Detective Fiction &ndash; led her to mystery workshops, conferences and a writing group. She is the author of a mystery series featuring crime historian Lizzie Stuart. The fourth book in the series, You Should Have Died on Monday, will be published in April 2007. Copies of her mysteries will be available for purchase at the free program. </p>
