<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Vacationing in New York will be the theme of the New York State </p>
<p>Museum&rsquo;s next Family Fun Weekend, July 7 and 8. </p>
<p>  The Family Fun Weekend, presented by Fidelis Care, takes place from 1- 4 p.m. both </p>
<p>days. Activities, which are free of charge, are designed to help families prepare for and </p>
<p>enjoy summer travel in the state. <br />
    <br />
  On Saturday, Abbe Hahn-Hook, an educator with AnimaLovers, will discuss what pet </p>
<p>owners should do with their dogs and cats when they go on vacation. The organization, </p>
<p>which is based in Albany, helps homeless animals in upstate New York and encourages </p>
<p>proper care of pets. Hahn-Hook, who will be in Adirondack Hall, will answer questions </p>
<p>and bring an activity for children. </p>
<p>  Both afternoons, the New York State Tourism Bureau will have a table in the main </p>
<p>lobby to provide information and distribute items from the &ldquo;I Love New York&rdquo; campaign. </p>
<p>At 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, participants will get a chance to imagine </p>
<p>what the sky would look like if they were camping when the &ldquo;The Sky Tonight&rdquo; is </p>
<p>presented in the Museum&rsquo;s inflatable Star Lab Planetarium. The display will show the position of the </p>
<p>stars for Saturday and Sunday nights. The show, in the Carole F. Huxley Theater </p>
<p>(former Museum Theater), is limited to 30 people, who must obtain a free ticket</p>
<p>at the information desk in the lobby. In addition, tents from the Museum&rsquo;s teaching </p>
<p>collection will be set up in Adirondack Hall. </p>
<p>  Children may make a visor in their choice of color, decorated with their name or </p>
<p>favorite sports team, which they can wear on vacation. They can also color a summer </p>
<p>picture and glue it onto a background. Throughout the afternoon, they may participate in </p>
<p>a scavenger hunt with prizes. There will also be an activity packet to take home filled </p>
<p>with coloring sheets, word searches, puzzles and a &ldquo;boredom busters&rdquo; booklet. </p>
<p>  Family Fun Weekends, presented by Fidelis Care, offer theme-based family activities, </p>
<p>on the first weekend of the month. </p>
