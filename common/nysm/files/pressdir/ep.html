<div id="main"> 
<p> In a rare public exhibit, one of the nation's greatest documentary treasures -- President Abraham Lincoln's Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation -- will be on display at the New York State Museum on Thursday, October 7th as part of a weeklong series of educational programs sponsored by the New York State Museum, State Library and the City School District of Albany. </p>
<p> The handwritten document, which has been part of the New York State Library's collection since 1865, will be on display in the Museum's South Hall lobby from 1 to 8 p.m. A brief public program is scheduled for 6:45 p.m. on October 7th providing information about how the State Library acquired the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.  A facsimile of this important document will also be exhibited in the South Hall lobby throughout the week of October 4-8th.   </p>
<p> Also during that week, the City School District of Albany will bring about 4,000 fourth through eighth grade students to view a facsimile copy of the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. The actual draft document was written in Abraham Lincoln's own hand with edits from his Secretary of State William Seward, a former governor of New York. Students will also visit learning stations organized by the State Museum and the State Library. The educational programs will provide an opportunity to demonstrate how "primary sources" found at the State Museum and State Library can be used by teachers and students to enhance the curriculum. The use of "primary sources" is recommended in state learning standards for social studies at the elementary, middle school and high school levels. </p>
<p> The New York State Legislature purchased the four-page Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. The final Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that all persons held as slaves within states still in rebellion against the United States on January 1, 1863 "shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free" 
was issued on New Year's Day 1863. The Chicago Historical Society acquired the manuscript copy of the final Emancipation Proclamation but it was lost when the Society's building was burned during the great Chicago fire of 1871. </p>
<p> Lincoln read the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet on September 22, 1862 and told them that he would accept minor changes in wording. Seward, a lifelong abolitionist, wrote in certain additions. Except for these revisions, and the formal beginning and ending written by the chief clerk, the document is otherwise entirely in Lincoln's hand.</p>
<p> In February and March of 1864, the Army Relief Bazaar was held to raise money for the U.S. Sanitary Commission, a precursor of the Red Cross that helped provide medical care for Union soldiers. To assist the Bazaar in its fund drive, Lincoln donated the preliminary proclamation, sending it to Emily Weed Barnes through Frederick W. Seward, son of the secretary of state. On the very last day of the Bazaar, the manuscript was won in a lottery by abolitionist Gerrit Smith. Smith generously gave the proclamation to the U.S. Sanitary Commission to be sold to raise more money. Three days after Lincoln's funeral train passed through Albany on April 25, 1865, the Legislature purchased the proclamation for the New York State Library. </p>
<p> 	"Written in President Lincoln's own hand, the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation is one of the greatest documents in American history," said Janet M. Welch, state librarian and assistant commissioner for libraries.  "We are pleased to be able to give people the opportunity to view this fundamental part of our historic heritage."</p>
<p> 	"This document is a true national treasure," said State Museum Director Clifford Siegfried. "We hope teachers, students and the general public will have the opportunity to view it up close and become more aware of the many cultural resources found at the Museum and State Library that help to enhance their appreciation and understanding of American history."</p>
<p> "It's an honor for this district to partner with the Museum and the Library on an event that brings our students and their families that much closer to a significant piece of American history," says City School District of Albany Superintendent Dr. Eva C. Joseph. "Collaboration of this nature is a true testament that the Albany community cares about the education of our children. It makes me proud to think that someday these students will be able to tell their children they saw, in person, the Emancipation Proclamation, and all of us will have made that possible." </p>
