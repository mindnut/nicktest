<title>NYS MUSEUM STUDY DETAILS CAUSES OF MAMMAL MORTALITY </title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Medium and large-sized wild animals in North America are  more likely to be killed by humans than by predation, starvation or disease,  according to research conducted at the New York State   Museum. </p>
<p> The study was conducted by Christopher Collins,  a graduate student from the State University at Albany  and Dr. Roland Kays, the State   Museum&rsquo;s curator of  mammals.</p>
<p> Published online at <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-%201795.2011.00458.x/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-  1795.2011.00458.x/abstract</a> in the journal <em>Animal Conservation, </em>the research shows  the extent to which humans are affecting the evolution of mammals today and  will be used to predict the conservation threats that mammals face.</p>
<p>Although  studies of mortality causes have been conducted for many mammal species, this  is the first to gather this data together and examine trends across species.  Collins and Kays reviewed data for 2209 individual animal deaths in 69 North  American mammal populations across 27 species. They only considered studies  that used radio tracking collars to monitor animals because they are the least  biased in finding recently deceased animals. </p>
<p>Of  the 1874 deaths that had known causes, 51.8 percent were caused by humans.  Hunters killed 35.3 percent of the animals studied -- 29.9 percent legally and  5.4 percent illegally through poaching. Vehicle collisions caused 9.2 percent  of the deaths and 7.2 percent resulted from other human causes.<strong> </strong>Predation by other animals caused 35.2  percent of the deaths, disease accounted for 3.8 percent, starvation for 3.2  percent and other natural causes for 6.1 percent. </p>
<p> Data  included animals that lived in a variety of habitats throughout North America including urban, rural and wilderness areas. Animals in urban areas were more likely to  die from vehicle collisions, while  animals in rural and wilderness areas were more likely to die from hunting. Animals living in protected  areas had a 44 percent lower level of human-caused mortality.</p>
<p>Kays noted that &ldquo;this shows that legal  protection has a direct impact on the survival and evolutionary pressures faced  by animals.&rdquo; Larger species, especially carnivores, are more likely to be  killed by humans, with smaller species, particularly herbivores, dying more from  predator attacks. Although the deaths attributable to hunting by humans were  very high, none of these hunted populations were endangered. &ldquo;These results may  be more important when considering the forces driving modern evolution of  species, than their conservation status,&rdquo; said Collins. </p>
<p>The  study suggests that animals with traits that allow them to escape these  prominent mortality causes for longer will have a selective advantage. However,  the scientists conclude in the study that the pace of &ldquo;human activity may exceed<strong> </strong>species&rsquo; ability to adapt,  particularly in the face of habitat loss and climate change.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The research also noted a scarcity of knowledge about smaller  species, and Collins and Kays have since initiated new field research on the  cause of mortality in small mammals in New York State. </p>
<p> The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Started  in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural  history research and collection survey in the United States. Located on  Madison Avenue in Albany,  it is Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information about  programs and events can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the  museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
