<div id="main"> 
<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; The New York State Museum  will commemorate the 10th anniversary of the World Trade Center (WTC)  attack with a new multi-faceted exhibition and new additions to Museum  galleries that present the many ways this monumental event has been documented and  depicted a decade later. </p>
<p> The  Museum is one of 30 sites statewide that are opening &ldquo;<em>New York Remembers</em>&rdquo; exhibitions to recognize the anniversary. Governor  Andrew M. Cuomo announced the exhibitions as part of a statewide effort to  &ldquo;remember the day the world changed for all of us&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/</a>. The State Museum and the governor&rsquo;s office organized  the exhibitions, which feature timelines depicting the events of September 11,  2001 and historical artifacts from the collections of the Museum and the  National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum.  Support for the development  of the WTC timelines was provided by RBC Wealth Management and RBC Capital  Markets. </p>
<p>   The Museum&rsquo;s exhibition &ndash; &ldquo;<em>Reflecting on September 11, 200&rdquo; &ndash; </em>will  be open September 9, 2011 through  April 28, 2012 and will be open on Sunday, September 11 to commemorate the 10th  anniversary. Two parts of the  exhibition will be in West Gallery. One will focus on the creations of artists  who worked in the World   Trade Center  towers prior to 9/11, and the other will be a multi-media film installation depicting  the aftermath of the attacks and how an artist and filmmaker chose to respond.  On the walls outside of West Gallery there will be a photography display, as  well as an original mural, depicting first responders. There also will be new  artifacts and updates added to the permanent exhibition, The World Trade Center:  Rescue Recovery Response, and  elsewhere in the Museum. </p>
<p> &quot;Ten years ago New York lost a piece of its heart, but we  showed the world our courage and compassion&rdquo; said State Education Commissioner  John B. King Jr. &ldquo;The new exhibition and  the Museum&rsquo;s permanent World   Trade Center  exhibition are tangible, physical evidence that takes what happened  on that day off the pages of the textbooks and makes it a part of us. The Regents and I thank Governor  Cuomo and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, for helping bring this  exhibit to life.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Before the Fall:  Remembering the World   Trade Center  will display 40 works by 13 artists who were  part of a residency program at the World   Trade Center  from 1997 through September 10, 2001, which  was created by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (LMCC). In late summer of  2001, 25 artists started  their residencies in the North   Tower (WTC 1) on the 91st  and 92nd floors. As events on September 11 unfolded, one artist lost  his life, one would escape from the 91st floor and almost all of  them lost irreplaceable works of art. Before the Fall includes works that were recreated after being  lost, as well as new works created in response to the attacks. They not only  document the experience of the artists working in the World Trade   Center but also provide a  memory of a place that no longer exists. </p>
<p>A multi-film  installation &ndash; the <em>cedarliberty Project &ndash;</em> includes 100 hours of footage shot by artist Elena del Rivero, whose  studio-home directly across from the World   Trade Center  was badly damaged during the collapse of the towers. The footage was shot both  inside and outside of del Rivero&rsquo;s studio. The resulting film installation &ndash;  created in collaboration with filmmaker Leslie McCleave &ndash; reflects the enormity  of the tragedy&rsquo;s aftermath. </p>
<p><em>Documenting a Decade: From September 11, 2001 to  Today</em>, in West Hall, will showcase  photographs submitted by the public that document the post-9/11 world. All of  the photographs submitted for this exhibition will be available on Flickr.</p>
<p>Also in West  Hall is a mural depicting first responders at Ground Zero, created by artist  Chris Stain as part of the Living Walls project. The goal of Living Walls is to  raise awareness about the use of public space. It is designed to celebrate and  expand the role of art in the revitalization of our communities. In conjunction  with the symposium, artists from around the world will be creating murals  throughout Albany.  Stain grew up writing graffiti in Baltimore,   MD in the mid 1980s. Through  printmaking in high school he adapted stenciling techniques, which later led to  his work in street stencils and urban contemporary art. </p>
<p> A 28-foot-by-9 foot trailer, which was  used by family members of WTC victims at ground zero, will be on display in  Adirondack Hall. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey installed this trailer in the  early summer of 2002 to provide the families with a private space to view the  recovery operation. The trailer became a place of comfort where family members left  photographs, cards, sympathy posters, and other objects of remembrance.  Initially located at the south end of the World Trade   Center, the trailer was  moved several times to accommodate construction at the site. During one of the  relocations, the original trailer was replaced by a smaller one. The family  members installed the memorial objects in the new trailer. Last year, the  trailer was removed from the site to be stored by the Port Authority with other  artifacts from the World   Trade Center. </p>
<p>In the Museum&rsquo;s  permanent World Trade Center  exhibition visitors will be able to use iPads to access videos, images and  recorded oral histories documenting the personal experiences of some of those whose lives were touched by the events  of September 11, 2001. Survivors, family members of those who died, and rescue and recovery workers,  share powerful stories that evoke the moments of the day and aftermath. </p>
<p>There also are  new artifacts in the <em>Response</em> section  of the exhibition, which show how the world reacted to the 9/11 attacks with an  unprecedented outpouring of sympathy. Items include a tapestry, 22.5 x 144.5 inches, made by Yvonne  (Breitmar) Renner and Andreas Renner of Germany,  while they were students at the German   University of Pedagogy. Also  on display will be a rug made by Afghan rug weavers, a police patch from Peru, and an Australian flag left on a fence  around the former World   Trade Center  site. There also will be a banner constructed by Japanese elementary school  students and Japanese peace cranes that were left as keepsakes at the Tribute WTC Visitor   Center.</p>
<p><em> </em>With more than 2,000 artifacts, the State Museum  is the world&rsquo;s largest repository of objects recovered from the World Trade   Center site after  September 11, 2001. They are rotated through the Museum&rsquo;s permanent World Trade   Center exhibition, which  opened in September 2002. The Museum also supports  other institutions nationwide and around the world with their World Trade  Center-related exhibitions. The Museum&rsquo;s exhibition is online at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/exhibits/longterm/wtc/">http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/exhibits/longterm/wtc/</a>.</p>
