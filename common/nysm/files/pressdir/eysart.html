<p>ALBANY, N.Y.  &ndash; <em>Through the Eyes of Others: African  Americans and Identity in American Art</em>, organized by the Fenimore Art Museum  in Cooperstown, N.Y.,  opens September 8 at the New York   State Museum  as the next exhibition in the Bank of America Great Art Series.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> On  view through January 6, 2010 in the Museum&rsquo;s West Gallery, the exhibition is  the 21st installment of the Bank of America Great Art Exhibition and Education  Program, which brings art from New York  State&rsquo;s leading art museums and  collections to the State   Museum. This exhibition  juxtaposes 19th-century views of American life with contemporary  interpretations by prominent African American artists to examine how Americans  have constructed and interpreted race. Together, the more than 50 visual images and artifacts make it easier to  understand the role of race in American culture in the past and the legacy that  attitudes about race bring to bear in the present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Many of the works were amassed by 19th-century  collector Stephen C. Clark and the Fenimore   Art Museum. Additional  selections were culled from various public and private collections, including  those of the New York   State Museum.  The exhibition was curated by Gretchen Sullivan Sorin, director and  distinguished professor of the Cooperstown Graduate Program. </p>
<p> The art of the Fenimore   Art Museum &ndash; largely a 19th-century  collection -- includes many images of African Americans that fit within two  categories. Most of the images illustrate how the nation perceived its black  countrymen. They felt, as W.E.B. DuBois, African American writer and  intellectual, wrote in 1903, as if they were always looking at themselves  &ldquo;through the eyes of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The portraits commissioned by black  sitters, or works of art produced by black artists, offer viewers an  alternative perspective. In this second category, these self-presentations,  some of which are anonymous, show individual voices and distinct personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sorin  states that &quot;since our perceptions of one another are grounded in that  which we see, this exhibition  -- a new look at the collections of the Fenimore Art Museum  -- in concert with the work of a wide  variety of African American artists -- is designed as an exploration of visual  culture to start the conversation anew. Conversations about race are  uncomfortable and often avoided or denounced as no longer necessary. But such  conversations are the tools that we Americans use to collectively and continuously  expand our democracy.&quot; </p>
<p> <em>Through the Eyes of Others</em> contains a lithograph by Norman Rockwell, works by  celebrated artists such as painter Edward Lamson Henry and sculptor John Rogers,  and African American artists including Kyra Hicks, Whitfield Lovell, and Faith Ringgold. Also  on display are drawings, photographs, woodcuts, art objects, books and  ephemera. </p>
<p> One  notable artifact from the Fenimore Art Museum is the Van Bergen Overmantel, ca. 1733, an  oil painting on cherry wood that was part of a paneled fireplace wall in a  Dutch farmhouse in Greene   County. The overmantel  defines the social hierarchy in Dutch New York, depicting both black and white  servants. Unlike the black servants, the white indentured servants gained their  freedom once the indentured ended.</p>
<p> Creative Art Day, a free program on  November 21 from 1 to 3 p.m., is planned to complement the exhibition. It is designed to encourage families to participate in  artful activities.
