<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A nationally acclaimed, Emmy-nominated  documentary, profiling three elderly troop greeters, will be presented at the  New York State Museum Oct. 14 as part of a program that will also feature the  film&rsquo;s award-winning director and one of its leading characters. </p>
<p> &ldquo;<em>The Way We Get By</em>&rdquo; will be shown at 6:30  p.m. free-of-charge in the Museum&rsquo;s Huxley Theater. Following the 83-minute  film presentation, Director and writer Aron Gaudet and his mother, Joan Gaudet,  one of the troop greeters, will answer questions from the audience. </p>
<p>National Grid, the presenting  sponsor, is supporting the program in part to honor the company&rsquo;s veterans and  active duty soldiers, as well as those who have family members serving  overseas. Stewart&rsquo;s will sponsor a free ice cream social at the conclusion of  the program. Other sponsors are Wells Fargo, Dutch Apple Cruises, and Hilton Garden   Inn Albany   Airport. </p>
<p>Those wishing to attend the  Museum screening should call (518) 474-0076. The film is one of a series of  programs planned in conjunction with the Museum&rsquo;s <em>Citizen Soldier: New York&rsquo;s National Guard in the  American Century </em>exhibition, open through March 2011. </p>
<p>Nominated for  an Emmy Award this year, &ldquo;<em>The Way We Get By</em>&rdquo; has been called  &ldquo;profoundly humane&rdquo; by the <em>New York Times.</em> <em>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</em> said there  are moments in the film that &ldquo;cut right to your heart.&rdquo; This film is &ldquo;filled  with a rare honesty and intimacy that makes for a rewarding film experience,&rdquo;  said the <em>Los Angeles</em><em> Times.</em> </p>
<p> &ldquo;<em>The Way We Get By</em>&rdquo; is a seemingly  idiosyncratic story about a group of three senior citizens who gather daily at  a small airport to thank American soldiers departing and returning from Iraq or Afghanistan, but the film quickly  turns into a moving, unsettling and compassionate story about aging,  loneliness, war and mortality. Carefully building stories of heartbreak and  redemption, the film reminds its audience about how American society casts its elders,  and too </p>

<p>often its soldiers, aside. More importantly regardless of one&rsquo;s  politics, &ldquo;<em>The Way We Get By&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>celebrates three unsung heroes who share their love with  strangers who need and deserve it.</p>
<p> Since 2003,  Joan Gaudet (age 77), Bill Knight (age 87) and Jerry Mundy (age 75) and a  rotating group of volunteers, have greeted more than 1 million American  soldiers at the Bangor, Maine International Airport, a frequent  stopover for troops deploying or coming home. Despite their age and failing  health, the three dedicated and selfless volunteers have risen at all hours of  the day and night, regardless of the weather, to be at the airport to ensure that  the soldiers passing through there have someone waiting to welcome or bid them  goodbye. While the troops wait for their plane to be serviced they are offered  the free use of cell phones and the company of their hosts in the troop  greeters&rsquo; welcome center.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Hundreds  of Capital District soldiers are among those who have benefited from the warm  hospitality. But they are not the only ones. The film shows how the experience  has transformed the lives of the three troop greeters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;Witnessing firsthand how  her life changed in such positive ways, while at the same time touching the  lives of troops from all over the country, convinced me this was a story that  could inspire people,&rdquo; wrote Aron Gaudet about his mother&rsquo;s role as a troop  greeter. &ldquo;This is a unique film, encompassing important social issues and  controversial topics, while remaining a story that every American can support.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The  documentary has won 17 awards to date including the Audience Award at the Full Frame Film Festival and  Best Documentary at the Atlanta, Little Rock, Phoenix  and Newport Film Festivals. Most recently, the AARP awarded &ldquo;<em>The Way We Get By</em>&rdquo; an award for the  &ldquo;Best Documentary of 2009&rdquo;</p>
<p> Aron Gaudet has worked in television  news for over a decade and has won a total of eight Telly Awards, one national  Emmy nomination, two regional Emmy nominations, two Vermont Association of Broadcasters  awards, and a Michigan Association of Broadcasters award.</p>
<p> Gita  Pullapilly, the film&rsquo;s producer and interviewer, began her career as a  television reporter. She has been honored with a number of distinctions for her  work&mdash;including a national Emmy nomination, the University of Notre Dame    Asian American Alumni Association Exemplar Award,  two Associated Press Awards, a Michigan Association of Broadcasters Award,  three Telly awards, and a Northwestern University Scholarship for Outstanding  Storytelling. </p>
