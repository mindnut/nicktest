Come along for a trip back in time to the homes of Hudson River School artists Thomas Cole and Frederic E. Church. The trip to the northern Catskills will take visitors to Cedar Grove, in Catskill, New York where Thomas Cole established the foundation of the Hudson River School of landscape painting. Frederic Church came to Cedar Grove, now a National Historic Register site, to study art theory and practice with Cole. The other stop on the day's adventure will be Olana, the exquisite home created by Frederic Church between 1870 and 1891 just south of Hudson, New York. Visitors will spend time in the homes and on the grounds that served as respite and inspiration to these American artists. October is a particularly beautiful time of year in the Hudson River Valley. Lunch at a specially selected site in Hudson is included in the cost of the trip. The cost of the trip is $60. Reservations are required by October 4 and can be made by calling Travels thru History at (518) 372-0777 or by writing to tcolarco@nycap.rr.com</p>
