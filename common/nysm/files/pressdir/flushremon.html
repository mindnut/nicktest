<p>ALBANY &ndash; The  Flushing Remonstrance, the earliest known document in America arguing for  religious freedom, will be on exhibit at the New York State Museum on Sunday,  December 27 to commemorate the anniversary of its signing more than 350 years  ago.</p>
<p> Dated December 27, 1657, the  Remonstrance is considered by historians to be the precursor of the first  amendment of the Bill of Rights, guaranteeing Americans religious freedom. Scorched  by the New York State Capitol fire of 1911, the fragile document is part of the  collection of the New York State Archives and has only been exhibited 13 times  since 1945. It will be on display inside the Museum&rsquo;s <em>1609</em> exhibition in the &ldquo;Learning to Live Together&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>The  Remonstrance was written and signed by 30 English settlers in Flushing, Queens  to protest a decree prohibiting Quakers from worshiping in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam. The grievance was addressed to Peter  Stuyvesant, director general of the colony, who had banned members of &ldquo;that  abominable sect&rdquo; of Quakers from practicing their faith. The Remonstrance  asserted that the order was contrary to the &ldquo;liberty of conscience,&rdquo; under the  customs of Holland and the Dutch patent, or  charter, to the town of Flushing  (1645).</p>
<p> The historic record is a 1657  duplicate, copied by the provincial secretary into the minutes of the Dutch  Colonial Council. It includes text and signatures that were on the original  document. The whereabouts of the original petition is not known but it may have  been returned to the individual who presented it to Stuyvesant. The Dutch  Colonial Council minutes and other records of the New   Netherland government were transferred to the new British  government in 1664. The records were maintained by the secretary of the province of New York  until 1783, when they became the custody of the secretary of state of New York, who  transferred the Remonstrance and other Dutch records to the State Library in  1881. The Library was formerly housed at the State Capitol and the Remonstrance  was seared when a devastating fire swept through the Capitol on March 29, 1911.  The Remonstrance was transferred  from the Library to the newly established New York State Archives in 1978. </p>
<p> An iconic record of early Dutch  colonial government, the Remonstrance proclaimed the necessity of religious  freedom of conscience and toleration. In Biblical language, it cited divine  authority as superseding human authority. Although they were not Quakers  themselves, the signers risked life, liberty and property to protest the harsh  treatment of the newly-arrived Quakers. Some of the signatures were crossed  out, perhaps because the signers got &ldquo;cold feet.&rdquo; Of those who did sign, some  were arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p> The Remonstrance was last exhibited  in 2007 in Albany  during its 350th anniversary year. That year it also attracted  national media attention when it went on display at the Queens Public Library branch  in Flushing. The Library also hosted a  traveling exhibition in November featuring panel displays, written by a  descendant of two of the original signers of the Remonstrance. </p>
<p> In 2006, the Remonstrance was one of  several iconic artifacts from the collections of the State Archives, Museum and  Library that were displayed in connection with a program featuring a lecture by  nationally-known historian Kenneth Jackson. Jackson&rsquo;s  topic, &ldquo;But It Was in New York: America Begins in the Empire  State&rdquo; addressed New York State&rsquo;s  powerful and unique, but largely unheralded role in American History.
