<title>NEW STATE MUSEUM EXHIBIT FOCUSES ON BREEDING BIRDS	</title>

<p>ALBANY &ndash;New York State  has become the first state in the nation to publish the results of two breeding  bird surveys in the past 20 years, and the significant changes in breeding distributions,  discovered through these surveys, will be revealed for the first time in a new  exhibition opening at the State   Museum October 3. </p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Mapping the Birds of New York:  the Second Atlas of Breeding Birds in New York State,</em>&rdquo; open through  May 22, 2009, is based on two surveys of all of the bird species that breed in  the state. One occurred from 1980 to 1985 and the second was conducted from 2000  to 2005, so that biologists could determine what changes occurred over a 20-year  period. </p>
<p>The results are  available in a new publication, <em>&ldquo;The  Second Atlas of Breeding Birds in New    York State,&rdquo;</em> edited by Kevin J. McGowan and Kimberley Corwin. It contains extensive text,  maps and tables. The book also includes more than 250 pieces of original art  specifically commissioned to illustrate the breeding birds, and many of those  originals are displayed in the exhibition. The book should be available in the  Museum shop in December.</p>
<p>The atlases  show locations where each bird species breeds and provides information on the  many factors that affect bird populations. Although bird species generally  breed in particular areas regularly and predictably, birds can move and their  distributions can change over time. Scientists believe atlases are important  because the changes they uncover can reveal a great deal about the health of  the bird populations and the environment in which they live. If a species  occurs today in fewer areas than it once did, steps can be taken to prevent  further decline. </p>
<p>The surveys revealed  that 251 of the 467 species recorded in the state, also breed in New York. The other 200  or so species pass through on their way to other areas. Some only spend the  winter, while others turn up in the state now and then. </p>
<p>Certain trends  were reported. Although the number of breeding species stayed nearly the same,  the project found that several species were gained. Half of the species changed  their distributions significantly. Of those, more increased  than decreased. </p>
<p>One significant  species, however, is likely to disappear. The Loggerhead Shrike, already rare  during the first Atlas, is no longer breeding in the state, due to loss of  agricultural lands, collisions with vehicles and, perhaps, because of the  accumulation of pesticides from insects they eat.</p>
<p>The Brown Thrasher  declined by 30 percent, showing reduced populations in all sections of the  state. The Whip-poor-will&rsquo;s population decreased by almost 60 percent, possibly  due to industrial pollution, pesticide use and reduced availability of their  favored food source. </p>
<p>The survey also  noted the incredible expansion of Merlin breeding. The small falcon has established  populations both in the wilds of the Adirondacks  and in urban areas. These birds are very noisy when nesting; the screams they  make can be heard a long distance away.</p>
<p>As in the past,  the American Robin was found to be the most widespread species in New York. New York&rsquo;s&rsquo; ten most  common species have changed little in 20 years. However, some species, such as  the Wild Turkey, are now seen much more often than in the past. </p>
<p>The new atlas also  addresses the issue of global warming. Although a handful of species that breed  south of New York   State have shown a  significant northward shift, it is not clear yet whether this is in response to  climate change. The survey notes that several other factors complicate the  issue including New York&rsquo;s  varied geography and an increase in food availability.</p>
<p>More than 1,200  people submitted data for the breeding bird atlas project and spent about  155,000 hours in the field. Participants ranged from novice backyard observers,  to professional ornithologists, to a small number of paid surveyors who were  assigned to areas that were difficult to access, especially in the Catskill and  Adirondack Mountains. </p>
<p> The  survey was a cooperative project involving the state Department of  Environmental Conservation; the New York State Ornithological Association; Audubon  New York and Cornell University&rsquo;s  New York Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Department of Natural  Resources and Lab of Ornithology.</p>
<p>The State Museum is a program of the New York State Education  Department, the University of the State of New York and the Office of Cultural  Education. Located on  Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information about  programs and events can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the  museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
