<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; &ldquo;Life in the Adirondacks&rdquo; is the theme of the New York State Museum&rsquo;s next Family Fun Weekend, August 4 and 5.</p>
<p>The Family Fun Weekend, presented by Fidelis Care, takes place from 1 &ndash; 4 p.m. both days. Activities, which are free of charge, are held in and around Adirondack Hall on the Museum&rsquo;s first floor. </p>
<p> On Saturday, Adirondacks-inspired singer, songwriter and storyteller Christopher Shaw will visit. Shaw is a regular presence in schools throughout the state. Most recently, he produced &ldquo;Adirondack Serenade,&rsquo;&rsquo; a collection of ballads that reflect his devotion to the people of the mountains. </p>
<p> Also planned for Saturday is a presentation on &ldquo;Leave No Trace,&rdquo; a national education program that teaches the public how to enjoy recreational lands responsibly. Thaddeus Beblowski, a member of the Museum staff who has been trained by the organization, will lead the program, which emphasizes disposing of waste, hiking, building a campfire and pitching a tent in ways that minimize the impact on the land. </p>
<p> Aubrey Fleszar, a personal trainer at the Fitness Coach in West Sand Lake and a USA Triathlon certified coach, will also be on hand Saturday from 2:30 to 4 p.m. She will be available to talk to visitors about the Ironman Triathlon in Lake Placid that she competed in during 2004 and 2005. The event included a 2.4 mile swim, 112-mile bike route and a 26.2 mile run. <br />
  <br />
  Throughout the weekend there will be Museum Exploration Stations in Adirondack Hall. Included will be carts featuring touchable objects that highlight New York&rsquo;s gem and mineral resources, the natural history of the Adirondacks and adaptations of bear and moose to life in the Northeast. Also, tents from the Museum&rsquo;s teaching collection will add to the rustic ambiance. </p>
<p> At 2 and 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, participants will get a chance to imagine what the sky
    would look like if they were camping when &ldquo;The Sky Tonight&rdquo; is presented in the Museum&rsquo;s inflatable Star Lab Planetarium. The display will show the position of the constellations for Saturday and Sunday nights. The show, in the Carole F. Huxley Theater, is limited to 30 people, who must obtain a free ticket at the information desk in the lobby. </p>
<p> Throughout the afternoon both days, children may make a stained-glass woodland animal to hang from a window at home. There also will be a scavenger hunt with prizes and an activity packet to take home filled with coloring sheets, word searches and other activities. </p>
<p> Family Fun Weekends, presented by Fidelis Care, offer theme-based family activities and are held the first weekend of the month. </p>
