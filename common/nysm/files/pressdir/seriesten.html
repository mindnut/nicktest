<p>ALBANY &ndash; &ldquo;Ice Age Legacy &ndash; Rocks, Ice,  People&rdquo; will be the theme of the New    York State Museum&rsquo;s April lecture series, beginning  April 7.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The<strong> </strong>free lectures will be  offered on Wednesdays at 7 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. The schedule and topics are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>April       7 &ndash; &ldquo;A Brief Glacial History of NY on Ice.&rdquo; New        York State Museum scientist Dr. Andrew Kozlowski will discuss       the cause and effect of glaciation and provide an overview of New York&rsquo;s glacial       history, and recent progress and discoveries that refine our understanding       of glaciation and deglaciation in the Great Lakes Region. </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>April       14 &ndash; &ldquo;Giant Foods, Inland        Oceans, and Dead       Mammals.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Dr. Dave Franzi of       SUNY Plattsburgh will speak about the deglaciation and late glacial       environments of the northeastern Adirondack Mountains and Champlain Valley. He will present evidence       for catastrophic breakouts from large proglacial lakes and provide details       on a recent discovery of seal bones in the Champlain Sea       clay deposits. </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>April       21 &ndash; &ldquo;Mysterious Boulders, Rock Avalanches, and the Origin of &lsquo;Darwin&rsquo;s Boulders.&rsquo;       &rdquo; In 1833 Charles Darwin documented and was intrigued by an  association of huge boulders along the Atlantic Ocean in Tierra   del Fuego. Dr. Edward Evenson of Lehigh  University will use experience gained  from 30 years of field work around the world to unravel the mystery of &ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s Boulders&rdquo; This  talk is based on the article in the December 2009 issue of <em>GSA Today</em>, the Geological Society of America journal. </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>April 28 &ndash; &ldquo;After the Ice: Human       Colonization of New York.&rdquo; Humans first explored New York about 13,000 years ago, as       this region was emerging from the &ldquo;Ice Age.&rdquo; Dr. Jonathan Lothrop, curator       of Archaeology at the New         York State Museum, reviews ongoing research on       how and when  Native Americans colonized, and adapted to the Late Pleistocene landscapes of  New York between 11,000 and 8,000 B.C.</li>
