<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A man who has become a leader in promoting  awareness of missing persons as a result of having a missing loved one in his  own family will tell his moving story to families and friends of abducted  children and other missing persons at the 11th annual Missing  Persons&rsquo; Day ceremony Saturday, April 9 at the New York State Museum.</p>
<p> A  father of four, Frank Williams has devoted himself to working on behalf of  missing persons ever since one of his own children went missing. The child was  eventually safely recovered. In addition to sharing his personal story,  Williams will talk about his work as president of the advisory board of the  National Center for Missing Children&mdash;NY/Mohawk Valley Office and chairman of  the annual Ride for Missing Children.</p>
<p>The Missing Persons&rsquo; event is  held in conjunction with Missing Persons&rsquo; Day, which is observed annually on  April 6th, Suzanne Lyall&rsquo;s birthday. The former SUNY Albany student  has been missing since March 2, 1998.</p>
<p> Prior  to Williams&rsquo; speech, a ceremony will be held in the Museum&rsquo;s Huxley Theater,  beginning at 1 p.m., with Assemblyman James Tedisco as master of ceremonies. It  will include a talk by Doug and Mary Lyall, the parents of Suzanne Lyall, who  will discuss the Center for Hope, the Ballston Spa-based non-profit  organization they founded. This will be followed by remarks by Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings and other  notables.</p>
<p> Following  the speeches and presentations, members of families with missing loved ones  will place wreaths of yellow roses and hold a candlelight vigil at the Missing  Persons&rsquo; Remembrance monument, located on the southeast corner of Madison and  Swan Streets. Constructed in 2006, the monument features an eternal flame to  &ldquo;light the way home&rdquo; for the missing.</p>
<p> Jim  Viola, a filmmaker and husband of Patricia Viola, who has been missing from Bogata, New    Jersey since 2001, will present several short videos  about a variety of missing persons&rsquo; cases. The New York State Police, the  Department of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), and other organizations will be  present during the event to hand out literature and answer parents&rsquo; questions.</p>
<p> During  the morning of April 9, nearly 200 survivors and friends of missing persons,  are expected to attend a private morning session exclusively for the families  and missing person organizations, sponsored by the Center for Hope.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Imagine  one of the people that you love most disappears,&rdquo; said Mary Lyall. &ldquo;There is no  goodbye, no letter or last phone call. There is only silence and an empty place  in your heart that can&rsquo;t be filled by anything or anyone but that person. This  is the reality that families and friends of the missing must face every day.  The annual Missing Persons&rsquo; Day event offers the families the hope, support and  guidance they need to cope with this reality.&rdquo;</p>
