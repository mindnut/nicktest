<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, N.Y. &ndash; A new two-day exhibition  -- &ldquo;From New York to the White House, New York Residents Who Became President&rdquo; --  will open Presidents&rsquo; Day in the lobby of the New York State Museum featuring  George Washington&rsquo;s 1796 farewell address. </p>
<p> Open  Monday and Tuesday, Feb. 20-21, the exhibition will honor the nation&rsquo;s first  president as well as New York&rsquo;s  political leaders who rose to the presidency. </p>
<p> The  exhibition will include several important artifacts from the George Washington  Collection at the New York State Library. Among these will be an original draft  of George Washington&rsquo;s Farewell Address, penned in his hand, which was sent to  Alexander Hamilton for comment and revision on May 15, 1796. It was rescued  from the fire that ravaged the State Capitol in 1911. One of General  Washington&rsquo;s dress swords will also be on display. According to Washington family tradition, the sword was presented to Washington by Frederick  the Great, King of Prussia. The sword was  purchased by the State of New York directly  from Washington&rsquo;s family in 1871 and is  depicted in the Washington  portrait that hangs in the United States House of Representatives. The display  will also include leaves from an extremely rare volume entitled &ldquo;<em>A </em><em>Representation of the Cloathing of  His Majesty's Household and of all the Forces upon the Establishments of Great  Britain and Ireland</em>,&rdquo;  1742. This collection of colored engravings of British military uniforms was given  to Washington  in 1787. </p>
<p> Eight  New York  residents who became president are recognized including Martin Van Buren,  Millard Fillmore, Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A.  Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight  D. Eisenhower..</p>
