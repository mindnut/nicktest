<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; Harvest time will be the theme of the New York State   Museum&rsquo;s next Family Fun Weekend, September 20 and 21. </p>
<p> The Family Fun  Weekend takes place from 1- 4 p.m.  both days. Activities, which are free of charge, are held in and around Adirondack Hall, on  the Museum&rsquo;s first floor. </p>
<p> On Saturday only,  at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. in the  Huxley Theater, licensed raptor rehabilitators Jim Parks and Julie Anne Collier will present  live eagles, hawks, owls and falcons as they discuss the migration patterns of North  American birds of prey. Parks andCollier are founders of Wingmasters, an organization based  in western Massachusetts  that uses educational programs to raise awareness of raptors or  birds of prey and theuncertain future some face as endangered species. </p>
<p> &ldquo;It gives people a  chance to see up close what is virtually impossible to see in the wild,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Parks. &ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t exotic birds, these  are birds that are native to New York,  or used to be and no longer are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Goolds Orchards in Schodack will be in the lobby on Saturday from 1 to 4  p.m. and will present a video showing the  cider-making process. Both days,  children will receive an activity packet and can make and take home a fall-themed craft.</p>
