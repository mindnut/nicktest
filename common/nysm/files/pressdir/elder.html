<p>Two photography exhibitions -- Elder Grace: The Nobility of Aging and Passing the Legacy: Reflections of Our Elders -- open at the New York State Museum on Friday, October 29th.</p>
<p>Elder Grace features more than 50 photographs taken by New York Times photographer Chester Higgins Jr. that honor African-American men and women who have found beauty within themselves and are experiencing aging with energy, wit and grace. The New-York Historical Society organized the exhibition.  The Passing the Legacy exhibition includes photo portraits of 11 prominent Capital District residents, photographed by J. El-Wise Noisette of Albany. The exhibition, presented by Albany District Links, in collaboration with Black Dimensions in Art Inc., emanated from a Links-sponsored oral history project that honored 13 area residents over the age of 75 for their outstanding contributions to the community. A video - "Passing the Legacy of the Black Family: Conversations with our Elders" will also be shown in the gallery. Both exhibitions will be in the Museum's Exhibition Hall through April 7, 2005.</p>
<p>The portraits in Elder Grace are the first fruits of labor of a broader portrait study of elders from all ethnic backgrounds, which Higgins began two decades ago. "I wanted to fathom the depths of the aging experience of the elders I chose - to reveal their character as it is exquisitely defined in their faces," said Higgins. </p>
<p>His photos honor African-Americans from all walks of life, such as writer/actor Ossie Davis, photographer/film director Gordon Parks and lesser-known Americans including a domestic worker, homemaker, teacher, attorney, sculptor and others. Their common bond is that "these are people who are comfortable within themselves - who have attained the seasoned dignity and grace that only older age can impart," said Higgins.  His goal is "to encourage us as a society.to stop denigrating ourselves," to embrace the natural signs of aging "and glory in the strength of mind and character gained from years of living."</p>
<p>A New York Times photographer since 1975, Higgins has authored several books, including 
"Feeling the Spirit" and his photos have appeared in Look, Life, Time, Newsweek, Fortune, Ebony and Essence. His work was the subject of a PBS documentary and has been featured on the CBS "Sunday Morning News," PBS "Newshour" and other major network programs. Higgins' one-man exhibitions have appeared at the Smithsonian Institution, the International Center of Photography, the National Civil Rights Museum and The Field Museum of Natural History. </p>
<p>Noisette also has had a lifelong passion for photography. He is a New York State Senate photographer and has photographed luminaries such as President Clinton, Senator Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. His work was shown in a group exhibition - Through Our Eyes, sponsored by Black Dimensions in Art at the Schenectady Museum. </p>
<p>Included in the Passing the Legacy exhibition are artist/activist Margaret B. Cunningham and community leader James A. Stamper, both of Schenectady; social worker/activist Florence E. Frazier of Colonie; teacher/speech pathologist Minnie Smith Hall, playwright/author Mars Hill, educator/author Marian I. Hughes, mentor Ida Jones, volunteer Juanita L. Lewis, volunteer Virginia C.
