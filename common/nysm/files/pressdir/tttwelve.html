<div id="main"> 
<p style="text-align:justify;">ALBANY  &mdash; Time Tunnel, the New York State Museum&rsquo;s 25th annual summer day camp,  will be held in two-week sessions from July 2 through August 10. Time Tunnel offers a diverse approach to learning  in the creative environment of a natural history museum. A staff of educators,  scientists, artists, counselors and outstanding college students work together  to provide day campers with summer activities that are both fun and  educational. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  camp is open to children entering first through eighth grades and is divided  into three two-week sessions, each with a different theme. Participants can  register for one of the sessions or for the entire program. A limited number of  one-week sessions are also available. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> </p>
<p><strong>Session 1: July 2-13 </strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Extinct and DeFunked&rdquo;</strong> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From dinosaurs to dodos, to long-lost  languages, fossils and outdated gizmos and gadgets, campers and Museum staff  will explore things that have disappeared.  Where are all of the Wooly Mammoths and Mastodons? What happened to the Passenger Pigeon or the  rotary phone, a television with no remote control? Time Tunnelers will investigate the ever  changing environment and everyday world in which we live. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
<p><strong>Session 2:  July 16-27 </strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Glory of Stories&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Campers will explore stories within many of  the Museum&rsquo;s exhibits, learning about Ice Age hunters, lumberjacks and the  Bucket Brigade. Campers will climb  inside the Museum&rsquo;s Starlab to learn about constellations and hear stories from  various cultures. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
<p><strong>Session 3: July 30-August 10</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Time Tunnel&rsquo;s  Greatest Hits&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This is Time Tunnel&rsquo;s 25th year and  campers will be treated to a variety of the most popular programs including  &ldquo;Born to be Wild&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tough to be a Bug&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  fee for each two-week session is $400, or $1,100 for all three sessions, if application  and payment is postmarked by May 4.  After May 4 the fee is $450 per session.  Time Tunnel Extra is available for early morning and late day care for  an additional fee.
