<title>PBS DOCUMENTARY COMING TO NYS MUSEUM DEC. 11 </title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; The New York State Museum will present a PBS  documentary December 11 about the Scotia-based New York Air National Guard Airlift  Wing&rsquo;s journey to Greenland with a team of international scientists  investigating global warming.</p>
<p> &ldquo;<em>Arctic  Air: A Greenlandic Journey with the 109th</em>&rdquo; will be shown  free-of-charge at 2 p.m. in the Museum&rsquo;s Huxley Theater. Following the film  there will be a question-and-answer session with Amy Manley,  the film&rsquo;s producer and Lt Col Kurt Bedore, a navigator from the 109th Airlift  Wing. </p>
<p>The documentary was produced by WCNY,  a PBS television station in Syracuse, which  traveled alongside American and international teams of scientists as they were  transported to Greenland by the 109th  Airlift Wing in the summer of 2009. </p>
<p>Flying the United  States Air Force's only ski-equipped C-130 Hercules cargo planes, the Wing  provides vital support for polar researchers working in the Arctic and Antarctica. &ldquo;Arctic Air&rdquo; captures the Wing  members' commitment as they face many challenges in a frozen land that is both  beautiful and dangerous. The skilled pilots and their crews transport supplies,  cargo and staff to and from Greenland in  temperatures that threaten to freeze their planes' fuel and hydraulic fluid. </p>
<p>The film shows the  camps where American and international teams of scientists seek to unlock  mysteries of the past buried deep within the polar ice cap to help provide  answers to some of today's most important questions about climate change and  global warning. Lack of pollution, unique topography and untouched flows of  glacial ice have made the Greenland ice sheet  an ideal laboratory for this research. The 109th Airlift Wing  missions have made it possible for scientists from around the world to gather  the critical data that is now shaping political, environmental and economic policies on climate change. </p>
<p>WCNY is  also providing an online teachers&rsquo; guide to the documentary with  grade-appropriate activities and links to educational resources for classroom  and student research use. The suggested activities focus on the topics  introduced in the film including scientific Arctic exploration, Arctic  aviation, climate control, global warming, life in Greenland,  and unique career opportunities for students to explore. </p>
<p> Funding  for &ldquo;<em>Arctic Air: A Greenlandic Journey with the 109</em>th&rdquo; is provided by CH2M HILL  and Lockheed Martin.  More  information on the documentary and the teachers&rsquo; guide is available at <a href="http://www.wcny.org/arcticair">www.wcny.org/arcticair</a>.
