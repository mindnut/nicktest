<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Two exhibitions  &ndash; one showcasing African-American quilts, and another displaying fiber and  needle arts by and for men of the African diaspora &ndash; open at the New York State Museum  December 21.</p>
<p><em>Textural Rhythms: Constructing the Jazz Tradition,</em> and <em>My Brothers&rsquo; Thread: Fiber Works by and for Men of  the African Diaspora,</em> will be on display in  the Museum&rsquo;s Exhibition Hall through March 1.</p>
<p><em>Textural Rhythms</em> unites the two most well-known  and popular artistic forms in African-American culture &ndash; jazz and quilting. Jazz, like quilting, is a woven art  form. Both genres produce a textural harvest spun from the life fibers of  masters of the imagination who create for our contemplation. Quilt making, as  in jazz, evokes a host of complex rhythms and moods and then captures them in  the creative process. When the two forms connect, the creative energy explodes  exponentially. <em>Textural Rhythms:  Constructing the Jazz Tradition </em>releases both of these genres of art and  becomes a showcase for the work of artists in the Women of Color Quilters  Network. Carolyn Mazloomi, the Network&rsquo;s founder and coordinator, curated the  traveling exhibition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The exhibition, part of a national  two and one-half-year tour, showcases approximately 64 quilts from 55 artists.  It includes work from some of America&rsquo;s  best-known African- American quilters such as Michael Cummings, Ed Johnetta  Miller, Tina Brewer, and Jim Smoote. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the varied styles of jazz  cause listeners to respond differently, the quilts of <em>Textural Rhythms</em> persuade viewers to salute the bonding of two worlds, jazz and quilts, in a  distinguished combination of cultural tradition, sophistication, and panache. Regardless  of technique &ndash; unpretentious folk, intricate appliqu&eacute;, conventional piecing, or  complex montage -- these quilt artists have harnessed in cloth, the spirit of  jazz through meticulous reflections of the souls of jazz folk and the music  that sways them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Creative Art Day, a program that  invites families to participate in artful activities based on Museum  exhibitions, will focus on Textural Rhythms. The free program will be held  January 31 from 1 to 3 p.m.</p>
<p> <em>My Brothers&rsquo; Thread: Fiber Works by and for Men  of the African Diaspora</em> gathers artists of diverse cultural backgrounds, from Harlem to  Trinidad to Newark,  to show that a single thread  can bind a community together. </p>
<p>In Western culture, fiber and needle arts have  traditionally been viewed as the realm of women. African men, however, have  been at the forefront of weaving and other textile arts for centuries. <em>My Brothers&rsquo; Thread</em> engages the mind,  dismisses myths about traditional roles in fiber and needle arts, and explores  the many talents African culture offers to the world. By doing so, it highlights  the positive aspects of men of the Diaspora<strong> </strong>and fosters new avenues for children to embrace.<strong></strong></p>
<p>The exhibition  includes quilts and other mixed media by artists Robert Cash, Laura R. Gadson,  Jerry Gant, Stuart McClean, Marvin Sin and Maluwa Williams-Myers. It was organized by Harlem Needle Arts (HNA),  Inc., a craft institute founded in 2003 to preserve and promote fiber art and  artisans of the African Diaspora. HNA  organizes exhibitions and workshops to introduce needle arts and crafts to the Harlem community and provides resource development and  technical assistance to artists.</p>
