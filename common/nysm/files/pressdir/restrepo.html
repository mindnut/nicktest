<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; &ldquo;<em>Restrepo</em>,&rdquo;  a powerful, nationally acclaimed, award-winning documentary, co-directed by the  best-selling author of &ldquo;<em>War</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>The Perfect Storm</em>,&rdquo; will debut locally  at the New York State Museum July 6 as part of a program featuring  the film&rsquo;s other director and award-winning photographer, as well as one of its  main characters. </p>
<p> &ldquo;<em>Restrepo: One Platoon, One Year, One Valley</em>&rdquo;  will be shown free-of-charge at 6:30 p.m. in the Huxley Theater after making  its national debut June 25 in New York City and Los Angeles. On July 9  the film will also be shown at the Spectrum Theater. </p>
<p>Those wishing to attend the  Museum screening should call (518) 474-0076. The film is one of a series of  programs planned in conjunction with the Museum&rsquo;s <em>Citizen Soldier: New York&rsquo;s National Guard in the  American Century </em>exhibition, open through March 2011. </p>
<p>Presented by National Geographic Entertainment, &ldquo;<em>Restrepo</em>&rdquo; was named the best documentary  in January at the Sundance Film Festival. The <em>New York Times</em> called the film an &ldquo;impressive, even heroic feat of  journalism&rdquo; that should be on the &ldquo;short shelf of essential 21st-century  combat movies.&rdquo; The current issue of <em>Rolling  Stone</em> refers to the film as &ldquo;explosive, deeply moving and impossible to  shake.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;<em>Restrepo</em>&rdquo; chronicles 12 months of a deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan's  remote Korengal Valley, called the &ldquo;deadliest place on  earth&rdquo; by one of the soldiers in the documentary. Before the outpost was closed  50 American soldiers had died there. </p>
<p> This  is an entirely experiential film. There are no interviews with generals or  diplomats. The goal is to make viewers feel as if they have just been through a  94-minute deployment. The film is rated R and is not suitable for children  (those under 17 must be accompanied by a parent).</p>
<p> Following the film&rsquo;s presentation, there  will be a question-and-answer session featuring Tim  Hetherington, the film&rsquo;s co-director and award-winning photographer, as well as  Sgt. Brendan  O&rsquo;Byrne, one of the soldiers who appears in the film. O&rsquo;Byrne is also the main  focus of the first few pages of &ldquo;War,&rdquo; the companion book to &ldquo;<em>Restrepo</em>.&rdquo; Sebastian Junger, the book&rsquo;s  author and the film&rsquo;s other director, writes in the book that O&rsquo;Byrne was &ldquo;just  one soldier out of thirty but seemed to have a knack for putting words to the  things that no one else really wanted to talk about. I came to think of him as  a stand-in for the entire platoon.&rdquo; In a June 20 <em>New York Times </em>article on the film O&rsquo;Byrne said that there are  still parts of the film he can&rsquo;t watch. </p>
<p>&ldquo;War&rdquo;  will be available for purchase the evening of the screening and Hetherington  will sign event post cards. Hetherington is an acclaimed photographer and  filmmaker who has reported on conflict for over 10 years. He broke his ankle  when he fell down the mountain in the Korengal Valley.  Hetherington is the recipient of four World Press Photo prizes, including World  Press Photo of the Year (2008) and an Alfred I. duPont Broadcast Award (2009)  for his work in Afghanistan.  A native of the UK, he is  based in New York  and is a contributing photographer for &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo; magazine. Hetherington's  book about the soldiers will be published in October. </p>
<p> From May 2007 to July 2008, Battle  Company of the 173rd Airborne Brigade was stationed in the Korengal Valley  of eastern Afghanistan.  The soldiers of the Second Platoon built and manned the remote and strategic  outpost that they named &ldquo;<em>Restrepo,</em>&rdquo;  in honor of their medic, PFC Juan Restrepo, who was killed in action. In the past five years the Korengal Valley  &ndash; a rugged valley six miles long near the border with Pakistan &ndash; has become an epicenter of the U.S. war in Afghanistan. It was considered to  be a crucial relay point for Taliban fighters moving from Pakistan toward Kabul, and several top Al Qaeda leaders were  thought to have used it as a base of operations. </p>
<p> Starting in June 2007, Hetherington  and Junger dug in with the men of the Second Platoon, making 10 trips to the Korengal Valley on assignment for &ldquo;<em>Vanity Fair</em>&rdquo; magazine and ABC News. By  the end of the deployment, Hetherington and Junger had shot a total of 150  hours of combat, boredom, humor, terror, and daily life at the outpost.
