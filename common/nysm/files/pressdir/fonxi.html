<p>(ALBANY,   NY) <em>Focus on Nature XI: Natural History Illustration</em> opens April 12 at the New York State Museum,  showcasing world-class, juried artwork by top illustrators from 13 countries. </p>
<p>This exhibition, open through October 31in the Photography Gallery,  will feature 93 natural history illustrations, representing the work of 73 illustrators from the U.S., Australia, Brazil,  Canada, England, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand,  Portugal, South Africa and Spain. The subjects represented are diverse, ranging  from those only found in the artists&rsquo; home country to those that have a  worldwide distribution. They include the Short-beaked Echidna, the Platypus, and the Leadbeater&rsquo;s Possum, all mammals  found only in Australia, and  the Red Andreaea, a plant endemic to the Agulhas  Negras Mountains of Brazil.  Also represented are many birds familiar in the northeastern U.S. such as the Peregrine Falcon,  Barred Owl, Connecticut Warbler, House  Sparrow, and one of the world&rsquo;s most  widespread -- the Barn Owl. There also are illustrations of an African Dung  Beetle, along with the producer of its nourishment -- an African elephant. Also  included are recreations of extinct organisms such as the Apatosaurus (a dinosaur), <em>Deinosuchus</em> (an ancient crocodile), and <em>Odontochelys </em>(the ancestor of turtles.) </p>
<p>A five-member jury of artists and scientists selected the pieces  on display, based on the illustration&rsquo;s educational value and artistic quality.  The exhibition&rsquo;s goal is to demonstrate the important role illustration has in  natural science research and education, to stimulate curiosity about the world,  and bring clearly into focus images of nature that people might not otherwise  be able to visualize. Jury Awards will recognize the outstanding achievement of  these artists. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Natural history illustration is both useful to science and  appealing to the general public and yet it is an art form that is not often  exhibited.&rdquo; said Patricia Kernan, exhibition curator and scientific illustrator  at the Museum. &ldquo;Most people do not realize that illustrations are still often  the primary means used  to record science and give explanations of the natural world. While very  useful, photography cannot completely  replace the accuracy, clarity, and flexibility of good illustrations. For  instance, special diagnostic  features can be highlighted, the juxtapositioning of important information can  be accomplished, abstract concepts can be diagramed, and extinct organisms can  be brought to life. There are examples of all of these in this exhibition.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Many of the illustrations are created for field guides, textbooks,  science articles and presentations. Some of these publications are included in exhibition  cases.

An interactive with this information also will be in the exhibition gallery.</p>

Started in 1836,  the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history  research and collection survey in the United States. The Museum is  located on Madison Avenue in Albany.
