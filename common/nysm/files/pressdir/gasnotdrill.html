<title>STATE MUSEUM SCIENTISTS TO STUDY GLACIAL LAKES IN ESOPUS VALLEY</title>

<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; During the week of June 28, New York  State Museum  geologists will collect sediment cores in the Esopus  Valley and its tributary valleys to conduct  research relating to climate change, as well as to assist in improving the  quality of New York City&rsquo;s  water supply. </p>
<p>The research project, funded by the  National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, will involve mapping the  location and thickness of clay deposits in the Esopus Creek watershed. The clay was deposited in large lakes dammed  by glacial ice during the most recent retreat of the continental ice sheet from  New York State between 20,000 and 12,000 years  ago. During their existence, the glacial  lake basins accumulated thick deposits of layered silt and clay that record  information about climate change. Geologists hope to extract  paleo-climate data from the recovered sediments  to help determine the timing of the lakes' existence and the ice retreat. </p>
<p>The second, and more pragmatic,  reason for locating the clay deposits in Esopus Creek watershed is because  Esopus Creek water flows into the Ashokan Reservoir, one of the Catskill water  supply reservoirs for New York City&rsquo;s  drinking water. Floods in the Esopus  watershed have caused stream bank erosion and landslides that expose these lake  clay sources and increase the amount of clay suspended in the water (turbidity). </p>
<p>Because of the importance of  identifying the distribution of these potential turbidity sources in the  Ashokan watershed, the New York State Museum  has coordinated this effort with the Ashokan Watershed Stream Management  Program, a partnership of Cornell Cooperative Extension in Ulster County,  the Ulster County Soil and Water Conservation District, and the New York City Department  of Environmental Protection. Knowing the  location and extent of clay deposits will aid the Ashokan Watershed Stream  Management Program&rsquo;s proposed management strategies for improving the quality  of New York City's  drinking water.</p>
<p>The New York   State Museum  is a program of the New York State Department of Education&rsquo;s Office  of Cultural Education. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously  operating state  natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison Avenue  in Albany, the  Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas  and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be obtained by  calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
