<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY,  NY &ndash; The New York State Museum, in association with the Smithsonian  Institution&rsquo;s National Air and Space Museum, and Soundprint Productions, will  present a series of educational videos and live video conferences, beginning  February 19, on the early days of NASA and the role that women and African-American  pioneers played in the success of the U.S. space program.</p>
<p>The free &ldquo;Out of This World&rdquo; program  is designed for students aged 10 to 14, with the goal of engaging, inspiring  and educating youth, especially underserved youth, about the pioneers who broke  through barriers to make significant contributions to science and engineering. </p>
<p>The first program on February 19 will  be held at 11 a.m. in the State   Museum&rsquo;s Huxley Theater and  will address the issue of &ldquo;Race and the Space Race.&rdquo; The live video conference  will originate from the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) and will allow  students to talk with the pioneers who shaped American space history. Answering  their questions will be NASA pioneers<strong> </strong>Morgan Watson, the first African-American engineer at NASA, and  Julius Montgomery, the second African-American hired at what was then Cape Canaveral. </p>
<p>Watson worked on heat transfer in  rocket engines and helped design the heat shield that protected the liquid  oxygen fuel from the heat of the escaping gases. Montgomery was involved in building circuits  and dealing with missiles and rockets that misfired.</p>
<p>Several artifacts at NASM will be  shown via videoconference, including the first ultraviolet camera, designed by  African-American scientist George Caruthers; a Sputnik replica and Explorer 1.  Participants will also hear President John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s historic speech  directing NASA to land a man on the moon.</p>
<p>The second video conference will be during Women's  History Month on Friday, March 5 at 3:30 p.m. It will allow participants the  opportunity to talk with women scientists, engineers and astronauts about the role that women played in the space race.</p>
