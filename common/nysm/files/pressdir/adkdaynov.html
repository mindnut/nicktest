<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; The New York State  Museum will celebrate the Adirondacks and Lake Champlain on Saturday, November  3 with &ldquo;Adirondack Day,&rdquo; an inaugural daylong event that will complement the  Museum&rsquo;s exhibition on iconic Adirondack  photographer Seneca Ray Stoddard.</p>
<p> The  free event, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., will include a concert, lectures, displays,  tours and films presented by the New York  State Museum  and many of the North Country&rsquo;s leading  educational and cultural institutions.  Participating are the New York State Museum,  Adirondack Museum, <em>Adirondack Life</em> magazine, Fort Ticonderoga,  Great Camp Sagamore, John Brown Lives, Lakes to Locks Passage, Mountain Lake PBS,  Paul Smith&rsquo;s College, The Wild Center, and the Trudeau Institute. </p>
<p>The highlight of the day will be a 2 p.m. concert by award-winning  Adirondack folk musician, educator and story  teller Dan Berggren. Berggren&rsquo;s roots are firmly in the Adirondacks where he was  raised, but he has entertained audiences across the country and overseas in Belgium, Bulgaria,  Romania and Central Africa. Hearing stories and songs from local  friends and neighbors, he has developed a style that captures the spirit of the  mountains. He has produced 14 albums and has won awards from the NYS Outdoor  Education Association, the Association for the Protection of the Adirondacks, the Adirondack Mountain Club and SUNY  Fredonia.</p>
<p> Guided  tours will be offered of the Seneca Ray Stoddard: Capturing the Adirondacks  exhibition. Stoddard&rsquo;s photographs provide a visual record of the history and  development of the Adirondacks. His work was  instrumental in shaping public opinion about tourism, leading to the 1892  &ldquo;Forever Wild&rdquo; clause in the New York State Constitution.</p>
<p>The exhibition includes over 100 of Stoddard&rsquo;s  photographs, an Adirondack guideboat, freight  boat, camera, copies of Stoddard&rsquo;s books and several of his paintings. These  and other items come from the State Museum&rsquo;s collection of more than 500 Stoddard prints  and also from the collections of the New York State Library and the Chapman Historical  Museum in Glens Falls. An online version of the  exhibition is also available on the State   Museum website at <em><u><a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/virtual/exhibits/SRS/">h</a><a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/virtual/exhibits/SRS/">ttp://www.nysm.nysed.gov/virtual/exhibits/SRS/</a>.</u></em></p>
<p> The  events are presented by the New    York State Museum with the support of sponsors Paul  Smith&rsquo;s College and Stewart&rsquo;s Shops.</p>
