<p>ALBANY, NY --- &ldquo;Invaders&rdquo; comes to the New York State Museum on April 15 -- an exhibition that reveals some surprising facts about the many plants, animals and diseases that have moved into New York State and dramatically affected the ecosystems surrounding them.</p>
<p> Open in the Museum&rsquo;s Crossroads Gallery through March 15, 2009, the exhibition will focus on some of the myriad of non-native species that have come to New York from all over the world. Although most of these newcomers are benign, some invasive species can rapidly expand their population size and range, adversely affecting existing species or habitats.</p>
<p>The exhibition will provide information on various types of invasive species, some surprising facts about them, how they arrived in the state, and how and why they proliferate. It also will help visitors to identify the &ldquo;invaders,&rdquo; some of whom live in their own backyards, and learn what can be done to prevent them from spreading. Magnifying glasses, and a specimen table with a magnifying camera, will allow visitors to get an up-close view of some of the more than 50 specimens, which will be on display. There also will be photographs and video.</p>
<p>Some invasive species are ornamental plants, first brought to North America by early colonists and then, in large numbers, by immigrants in the 1800s. New plants continue to arrive for use in landscaping. On display will be one of the earliest collected specimens of a Purple Loosestrife, a perennial wetland plant on loan from the New York Botanical Garden. There also is a pressed sample of the massive Giant Hogweed, which can grow as tall as 15 feet. The Japanese Barberry, Water Chestnut and Oriental Bittersweet are among other examples represented.</p>
<p>The exhibition also will provide examples of the many invasive species that arrive via boats and planes, the result of global commerce. The Asian long-horned beetle, which has no known predators in North America and has killed many tree species, was accidentally transported here in wood packing material from Asia. Zebra mussels and quagga mussels, first detected in the Great Lakes in 1988, were initially introduced through ship ballast water but are now primarily transported by &ldquo;hitch hiking&rdquo; on barges and pleasure boats. The mussels have created imbalances in ecosystems in lakes and rivers, and caused billions of dollars in damage in water systems across the United States. </p>
<p>Some non-native species have been introduced by humans who considered them beneficial because they control weeds and pests or provide game. The Multi-spotted Asian Ladybug is an example of one such insect. It likely caused the disappearance of the nine-spotted ladybug, which was the most common ladybug in New York State until the 1940s, and is still the official state insect. The Mallard Duck was introduced as game in the Hudson Valley between the 1910s and 1950s.</p>
<p>The Honey Bee is native to Europe, the Middle East and Africa and was brought to the U.S. by colonists. It is not known what effect it had on bees native to North America but this is one of many invasive species that has benefited society. Modern-day earthworms are also not native. It is believed they came from Europe and Asia during the past 500 years. Native earthworms were destroyed by glaciers during the Ice Age. Although beneficial for gardens and agriculture, they may alter forest floor habitats by eating too much leaf litter.</p>
<p>Non-native, invasive diseases also present a major threat to native plants, animals, agricultural crops and even humans. They are typically introduced by accident, carried through landscaping materials, migrating birds or fish, ballast water, insects on aircraft, infected humans or firewood. The West Nile virus, transmitted by mosquitoes that primarily feed on birds, is native to Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia. First detected in New York State in 1999, it has since killed thousands of birds across North America, sickened over 25,000 humans and caused over 1,000 deaths. It is an example of an invasive species that is a global threat.</p>
<p> New York State residents have also contributed accidentally or, on purpose, to the worldwide expansion of invasive species. The Bluegill, a popular game fish found in New York State, was given by the mayor of Chicago to the crown prince of Japan as a gift in 1960. It became invasive in freshwaters of Japan and reduced the number of many native fish. The Eastern Gray Squirrel, native to the eastern U.S., was accidentally released from the London zoo and then introduced as a pet in Italy in the 19th century. It has since destroyed native trees and displaced the native Red Squirrel in Europe, where it has few natural predators.</p>
<p> The exhibition provides information on what visitors can do to prevent the spread of invasive species including cleaning boots, bikes and boats that can carry invasive species; buying only non-invasive plants and local firewood, and never releasing aquarium fish and plants, live bait or pets into the wild. </p>
<p> A May lecture series on &ldquo;Invaders&rdquo; is one of several programs being planned in the coming months to complement the exhibition. Sponsored by the New York State Biodiversity Research Institute, the lectures will be held every Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the State Museum. </p>
<p>A lecture on &ldquo;Landscaping with Native Plants,&rdquo; will be held June 21 at 1 p.m. at the Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center, followed by a field trip to special Pine Bush sites. On September 1, Dr. Dan Molloy, director of the Museum&rsquo;s Field Research Laboratory, and his staff, will explain how they investigate the biology, ecology and taxonomy of zebra mussels. The program will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Field Lab, near Cambridge. Pre-registration is required by June 13 for the Pine Bush event, and September 12 for the Cambridge program, and may be made by calling (518) 473-7154 or emailing psteinba@mail.nysed.gov. </p>
