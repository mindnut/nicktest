<p>(ALBANY, NY) --  A massive, iconic Confederate flag, torn down by a Colonel Elmer Ellsworth, a  soldier born in Saratoga County and widely remembered as the first Union  officer killed in the Civil War, is now on display at the New York State   Museum.</p>
<p> The 14-by  24-foot Marshall House Flag is being exhibited in South Hall through Feb. 24,  2013 in conjunction with the nearby 7,000-square foot exhibition on the Civil  War. <em>An Irrepressible Conflict: The Empire State in the Civil War</em> is open through September 22, 2013 in Exhibition Hall. </p>
<p>James Jackson hoisted the Confederate  national flag onto a 40-foot-tall flagpole atop his hotel, the Marshall House,  in Alexandria, Va.  shortly after the Confederates bombarded Fort    Sumter, S.C. in April  1861. The flag was so large that it was visible from the White House. Federal  forces, including Col. Elmer Ellsworth and the 11th New York Volunteers, crossed  the Potomac and entered Alexandria  on May 24, 1861.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old Ellsworth, formerly of Malta, decided to remove Jackson&rsquo;s flag from the Marshall House. With  a small party, including Corp. Francis Brownell of Troy, Colonel Ellsworth climbed to the roof  and cut down the flag. During their descent Ellsworth and his party encountered  Jackson, who was armed with a shotgun. Gunfire ensued, leaving both Jackson and  the charismatic Ellsworth dead. </p>
<p>The Marshall House incident became  national news and plunged the entire country into mourning &ndash; the North for  Ellsworth, the South for Jackson.  President Abraham Lincoln ordered an honor guard to deliver Ellsworth's body to  the White House for a funeral service. </p>
<p>Ellsworth had worked in Lincoln&rsquo;s law office in Illinois  when he moved there from his childhood home in Malta. He became a tireless Lincoln supporter during the election of 1860 and  accompanied him to Washington.  When war broke out, Ellsworth returned to New York State to raise a regiment.</p>
<p>Following the White House funeral,  Ellsworth&rsquo;s body laid in state at City Hall in New York   City and at the State Capitol in Albany, respectively, before being buried in  Mechanicville. The Marshall House flag accompanied Ellsworth's body home to New York state. Relics  connected to Ellsworth&rsquo;s death became prized possessions, including pieces cut,  or &ldquo;souvenired,&rdquo; from the Marshall House flag. </p>
<p>&quot;One really has to see this flag  in order to appreciate it,&rdquo; said New York State Historian Robert Weible. &ldquo;It's  enormous and its significance in American history isequally big.By  exhibiting this iconicflag, we are better able tocommunicate the  lasting meaning and relevance of the Civil War to a large and appreciative  audience.&quot;</p>
<p>In the collections of the New York State  Military Museum,  the flag was conserved at the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and  Historic Preservation&rsquo;s textile laboratory at Peebles  Island in Waterford. As part of the New York State  Battle Flag Preservation Project, the preservation and display of the Marshall  House Flag was made possible with generous support from the Coby Foundation.</p>
