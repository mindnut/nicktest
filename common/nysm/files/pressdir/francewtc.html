<p>(ALBANY, NY) &ndash; The New York  State Museum  has announced the June 26 opening of its second exhibition in France exploring the personal and  historical significance of September 11, 2001. </p>
<p>The exhibition, which first opened at  Le Caen Memorial in Caen, France on June 6, 2008, is traveling to the Oradour Memorial  Museum in Oradour-sur-Glane France, where  it will be on view in the Centre de la Memoire at Oradour through April 2010. </p>
<p>A major historical site in France, the  Memorial at Oradour-sur-Glane commemorates the site of the June 10, 1944 murder  of 642 civilians by a Waffen SS Division, which also destroyed the village. The  remains of the city, now known as the Martyrs&rsquo; Village, have been preserved and  are accessible through the Oradour   Memorial Museum. </p>
<p>The Museum decided to host the  exhibition on the World Trade Center (WTC) attack because it also commemorates  a tragedy where innocent civilians were murdered. The exhibition&rsquo;s goal is to  help visitors gain a clearer understanding of the events of September 11, learn  more about the people whose lives were lost, and provide visitors with a  platform to share their experiences relating to the tragedy. </p>
<p>Organized by the State  Museum, the exhibition &ndash; &ldquo;<em>September 11, 2001&rdquo;</em> -- features rare  artifacts from the World   Trade Center  recovered after the collapse, and a timeline that traces events of the day. It  includes personal stories and objects, images, interactive programs and films  about everyday life at the World   Trade Center,  and the aftermath of the attack. </p>
<p> About 4,000  square feet in size, the exhibition includes hundreds of photographs, and more  than 100 artifacts from the WTC towers, (many never before seen by the public),  from the State Museum&rsquo;s collections, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  (PANYNJ), and objects loaned by families and survivors of the attacks. The exhibition includes a PANYNJ  rescue vehicle destroyed on 9/11, personal objects linked to several individuals who perished or survived,  and expressions of sympathy from New York, such as the Times   Square scrolls, memorial fences and posters of missing persons. </p>
<p> The  exhibition is divided into themed sections. The introduction focuses on the World Trade   Center before September  11. A film of the ABC News John Miller 1998 interview with Bin Laden is  included. Visitors will also see WTC artifacts, photographs of the WTC, and  video/ films from the Power Authority of New York and New Jersey, showing everyday life at the  WTC. Facts about the site and WTC  construction are also included.  </p>
<p>In another  section of the exhibition, visitors<strong> </strong>experience a large walk-through timeline, with images, text,  artifacts and sound, designed to help visitors understand how the day unfolded,  the sequence of the attacks, evacuations and collapse of the towers. Objects include a WTC sign, steel and  aluminum facade of the tower, airplane pieces, a seatbelt from one of the airliners,  and rescue objects from the Fire Department of New York, New York Police  Department and FBI. Also included are objects recovered from the WTC site,  including the remains of an Alexander Calder sculpture, a destroyed fire  department vehicle, elevator signs, keys and evacuation signs. This area also  features <em>&ldquo;The First 24 Hours,&rdquo;</em> a film  by French filmmaker Etienne Sauret. </p>
<p>Another  section will feature images of and artifacts from Ground Zero and the recovery  operation at Fresh Kills, a former landfill on Staten   Island whose name, &ldquo;fresh stream,&rdquo; came from early Dutch settlers.  This area will show the extent of this historic and humanitarian operation that was designed to find remains of  every person lost, and their personal possessions Objects on display will  include WTC souvenirs, signs, rescue artifacts, destroyed lamppost fragments  and a recovered fragment of Auguste Rodin&rsquo;s bronze &ldquo;The Three Shades,&rdquo; from the  collection of Cantor Fitzgerald. </p>
<p> Biographies  of nine 9/11 victims and survivors, along with artifacts, are also included in  the exhibition to help to put a human face on the tragedy. </p>
