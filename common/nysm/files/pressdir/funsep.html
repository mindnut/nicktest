<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; &ldquo;Harvest Time in New York&rdquo; is the theme of the New York State Museum&rsquo;s next Family Fun Weekend, September 1 and 2. </p>
<p> The Family Fun Weekend, presented by Fidelis Care, takes place from 1 &ndash; 4 p.m. both days. Activities, which are free of charge, are held in and around the Museum&rsquo;s main lobby. </p>
<p> Families will have an opportunity to experience the state&rsquo;s rich agricultural heritage. Throughout the weekend, Altamont-based Indian Ladder Farms will invite visitors to participate a taste-test of their apples. The farm will have a display showing where such products as honey and maple syrup come from. A baby Pygmy goat will also be on hand. </p>
<p> On Saturday, Adirondacks-inspired singer-songwriter Dan Berggren will perform country harvest time songs. Also Saturday, a video will be shown featuring Alice Waters, an American chef and advocate of buying fresh, locally-produced food. The video was provided by Sandra Varno, a registered dietitian and nutrition educator with Cornell University Cooperative Extension of Albany County. A spinner will demonstrate wool preparation from fleece to yarn. </p>
<p> At 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday in the Museum&rsquo;s inflatable Star Lab, visitors can learn how Native People used the sky to determine when to harvest crops and when to hunt. The show will also cover mythology associated with the sky. The Star Lab will be set up in the Carole F. Huxley Theater. Attendance is limited to 30 people, who must obtain a free ticket at the lobby information desk. </p>
<p>    Throughout the afternoon both days, children may make Plaster of Paris harvest leaves that can be painted and used as refrigerator magnets. There will be a scavenger hunt with prizes and an activity packet to take home filled with coloring sheets, word searches and other activities. </p>
<p> Family Fun Weekends, presented by Fidelis Care, offer theme-based family activities and are held the first weekend of the month. </p>
