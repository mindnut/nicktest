<p>ALBANY, N.Y. &ndash; In celebration of  the 202nd anniversary of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s birth, the New York State   Museum will present a  series of three cooking demonstrations in February that highlight the evolution  of domestic food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cooking the Tree of Life &ndash; Food as Delicious  Evolution&rdquo; will be presented on three successive Wednesdays, beginning February  2, at 7 p.m. in the Clark auditorium. Each demonstration in the free program will  pair a local chef with a biologist sous chef, and the two will prepare the meal  together, providing both the culinary and scientific perspective on the main  ingredients. </p>
<p>The February demonstrations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>February 2, Swine and Dine -- </strong>Pigs and their porcine relatives       are used as food sources in many cultures, and 7,000 years of artificial       selection have resulted in the domesticated pig that is farmed today. Dr.       Jason Cryan, an evolutionary biologist at the State Museum,       will discuss the evolutionary origins, current distribution and biology of       pigs, while Chef Tony Destratis of the Lake George Club prepares and       presents inspired dishes. </li>
  <li><strong>February       9, Potato: The Perfect Human Food -- </strong>For the first few million years, the potato tuber       was just a nifty adaptation to help plants store a bit of energy       underground. Then humans discovered how nutritious it was, started       experimenting with its evolution, and created the perfect human food. Dr.       Roland Kays, the State        Museum&rsquo;s curator of       mammals, will provide the evolutionary back-story to the tuber that       changed the world, as the Food Network&rsquo;s Chef David Britton cooks up       examples of the cuisine it has inspired. </li>
  <li><strong>February       16, Loving the Bubbly: Bread, Wine and Beer -- </strong>The variety of breads and       fermented beverages developed by cultures around the world are made       possible by one species of yeast that has evolved into hundreds of       specialized strains. This microscopic fungus has been intertwined with       human evolution over the last 10,000 years, helping certain cultures to       flourish. </li>
</ul>
<p>Museum  scientist<strong> </strong>Dr.  Jeremy Kirchman and Chef Stephen Topper of the Copperfield Inn in North Creek,  will discuss the natural history of yeast as they prepare dishes together. </p>
