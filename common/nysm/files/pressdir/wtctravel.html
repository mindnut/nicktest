<p><strong>Recovery: The World Trade Center Recovery Operation at Fresh Kills</strong>, a new traveling exhibition from the New York State Museum documenting the historic recovery effort to locate human remains and personal objects from the collapse of the World Trade Center (WTC), begins a national tour at the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland, Ohio on August 15th.</p>
<p>Open through October 26th, the exhibition consists of 65 photographs and over 50 objects recovered from the World Trade Center. Collectively, they help to tell the unheralded story of what happened when the recovery effort moved beyond Ground Zero to Fresh Kills landfill, the "city on the hill" where recovery workers toiled for long, tedious hours at a disheartening task.</p>
<p>The landfill's name, which means "fresh stream," came from early Dutch settlers and described an area made up of meadows, marshlands and wetlands. The landfill operated for 50 years, encompassing 3,000 acres on the western shore of Staten Island. The last landfill in New York City, it was slated to close in March 2001 and become a wildlife refuge and park.  But, instead the landfill was declared a crime scene on the morning of September 12, 2001 and trucks began arriving from Ground Zero with the steel and crushed debris that were once the World Trade Center. The landfill was the ideal location for the recovery operation because it was reachable by land and water, it could be secured and resources of the New York City Department of Sanitation were readily available.</p>
<p>Firefighters, ironworkers, engineers, contractors, police officers, and volunteers eventually removed 1.8 million tons of debris from Ground Zero to the landfill. The recovery operation had three objectives: to find human remains, personal effects, and any evidence of the terrorist attack. The recovery operation quickly evolved from simple hand sorting into an elaborate technical sifting and sorting process.</p>
<p>From an encampment without phones, running water or electricity, Fresh Kills was transformed into a small city with heated and air-conditioned trailers and water facilities. The Hilltop Café, operated by the Salvation Army and the American Red Cross, served food and drink to over 
1,500 people a day. Structures were built around sorting tents to keep the staff comfortable and focused on their tasks. A supply tent was erected to provide everything from Tyvek suits to eye drops and sun block.</p>
<p>The New York State Museum staff became well acquainted with the army of workers from the New York Police Department (NYPD), FBI, 25 state and federal agencies and 14 private contractors, whose daunting, meticulous task was the sorting and examination of the World Trade Center material. Over time, an unprecedented partnership developed between museum staff and law enforcement personnel who became curators-at-large for the museum setting aside items that were not evidence or personal effects that they thought the museum might be interested in.</p>
<p>In addition to collecting objects, the Museum staff photographed the stark landscape of Fresh Kills, the sorting and sifting operations, hundreds of debris piles and vehicles, and the people involved in the recovery process.</p>
<p>The resulting exhibition includes a recovered American flag, several World Trade Center souvenirs, building keys, signs, guns and sections of the building facade, marble floor and a fragment of one of the planes. Among the rescue-related objects are a NYPD radio holster, New York Fire Department (NYFD) boot, a firefighter's Scott pack (oxygen tank) and a fragment of a destroyed fire truck. A touch screen interactive contains FBI film of the operations and an inventory of objects in the museum's collections.</p>
<p>"The New York State Museum faced a daunting task in the Fall of 2001" said Museum Director Clifford Siegfried. "As an educational institution which chronicles New York State history, the museum was challenged to select and preserve items from the World Trade Center attack that would speak to our own and future generations and help document an event that was unprecedented in our nation's history. We hope this exhibit will help Americans throughout the country to better understand the historic recovery operation which helped to bring some closure to a grieving nation."</p>
<p>"This exhibition shines a light on the many unsung heroes who worked tirelessly at the 'city on the hill' and offers a glimpse of what they found," said Mark Schaming, the Museum's director of exhibitions who led the WTC collections effort. "Over many months, State Museum staff became acquainted with key recovery personnel and was granted unique access to this historic material. Everyone came to realize that many everyday items were now artifacts that took on added significance because of where they had been, what they had gone through and what they represented." </p>
<p>The objects for the exhibition come from the New York State Museum's large collection of objects, art, oral histories and memorial material from Ground Zero and the Fresh Kills Landfill. Many of these make up what is the nation's largest and most comprehensive permanent exhibition about the World Trade Center history and September 11 attacks, which is at the Museum. <em>The World Trade Center: Rescue, Recovery and Response</em> opened to the public in September 2002.</p>
