<title>SUNY PLATTSBURGH FINDS, DONATES ANCIENT FOSSIL TO NYS MUSEUM </title>

<p>ALBANY, N.Y.  &ndash; Two students from the Capital District were among SUNY Plattsburgh  geology students who recently discovered the rare bones of an ancient harbor  seal that have now been donated to the geology collections of the New York State Museum.</p>
<p>Jason  Klein of Cohoes and Zachary Irwin of Burnt Hills  were with Jake McAdoo and other students collecting mud samples at the site of  the old Plattsburgh Air Force Base on Lake Champlain  when McAdoo&rsquo;s shovel hit something hard.</p>
<p><a href="http://weblog.plattsburgh.edu/focus/Harbor%20Seal%20Bones.jpg">
</a> &ldquo;Jake said that he thought  he hit a railroad spike. Then, he dug further down and said, &lsquo;No, I think it&rsquo;s  a bone,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Dr. David Franzi, SUNY distinguished teaching professor of earth  and environmental science, who had gone to the site with his students to lead  them in a landslide study for his environmental geology class. &ldquo;I told him,  &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s not a bone,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Franzi. &ldquo;You almost never find bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Franzi was wrong. It was a bone, and a very special bone at that.</p>
<p>Dr.  Robert Feranec, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the State Museum,  verified that the fossilized bones belong to a harbor seal. He believes they date  back to the existence of the Champlain   Sea, during the end of  the last glacial cycle about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. </p>
<p><br />
  According to Feranec, the  bones that have now been uncovered at the site include fibula, tibia, four  vertebrae, a jaw bone and what may be ankle and foot bones. <br />
  &ldquo;Seal fossils are a pretty  rare find for New York,&rdquo;  said Feranec. &ldquo;We only have two single fossil specimens in the State Museum  collections now, so this find of about 15 bones, including the jaw, is  significant.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />
  Feranec said the next steps  are to carbon date the fossils and conserve them before placing them in the New York State Museum&rsquo;s  permanent collections. They then will be available for research, as well as for  exhibits and education.<br />
  Franzi said his students were  very excited about the find, which relates peripherally to what they are  learning in the classroom. For students in his sedimentology and geomorphology  classes, however, there is a direct connection, and, according to Franzi, the  find helps bring his subject to life.</p>
<p>The  other students on the field trip were Brian Gamache of Plattsburgh,  Jacob Barnhart of Unadilla, Gregory Colucci of Ithaca  and Katherine Bazan of Poland,  N.Y.</p>
