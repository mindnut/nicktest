<title>FOSSILS OF EARTH'S OLDEST TREES DONATED TO STATE MUSEUM</title>

<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; Fossils of the Earth&rsquo;s oldest trees have been donated to<strong> </strong>the New York State Museum  after workers uncovered them during a project to reconstruct the Gilboa Dam in Schoharie County.</p>
<p>Engineers for the New York City Department of Environmental  Protection (DEP) discovered 35 Gilboa stump specimens in the same location  where similar Gilboa stumps were uncovered in 1920 when the dam was  constructed. Other smaller discoveries were made in the 1850s and in 1869. Twelve  new stumps will be added to what is now the world&rsquo;s largest collection of  Gilboa stumps at the State   Museum. The stumps are  widely cited as evidence of the world&rsquo;s oldest forest.</p>
<p>For decades scientists  did not know what the trees connected to the stumps looked like. This mystery  was solved in recent years. For the first time, the entire tree was pieced  together after Museum researchers found fossils of the tree&rsquo;s intact crown in  2004, and a 28-foot-long trunk portion in 2005. In 2007, <em>Nature</em>, a leading international journal of science, reported the  discovery of the 380-million-year-old &ldquo;stunning specimens&rdquo; in Schoharie County,  marking the first time paleontologists had seen the entire Devonian-Period tree.  The discovery was named  one of the &ldquo;100 top Science Stories of 2007&rdquo; by <em>Discover</em> magazine.</p>
<p>Linda Van Aller Hernick, the Museum&rsquo;s  paleontology collections manager and one of the co-authors of the 2007 <em>Nature</em> article, discovered the tree&rsquo;s  crown in 2004, along with colleague Frank Mannolini, paleontogy collection  technician. The year before, Hernick wrote &ldquo;The Gilboa Fossils,&rdquo; a book  published by the Museum about the history and significance of the fossils and  their use in an iconic exhibition about the Earth&rsquo;s oldest forest. The  exhibition, at the State Museum&rsquo;s former location in the State Education  Department building on Washington    Avenue in Albany,  had a profound influence on multiple generations of paleontologists worldwide. </p>
<p>One of the exhibition&rsquo;s key planners  was Winifred Goldring, the nation&rsquo;s first female statepaleontologist who was based at the State Museum.  She worked tirelessly to study and interpret the Gilboa fossils and named the  trees <em>Eospermatopteris</em>. In 1924, her  paper about the stumps, together with the Museum exhibition, brought the  &ldquo;Gilboa forest&rdquo; to the attention of the world.  Even today, the ancient Gilboa forest remains among the most famous and  important fossil sites ever discovered for this geologic period. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The original discovery of the Gilboa Forest  fossils documented the earliest known forest in the history of the world and  informs textbooks around the world,&rdquo; said Dr. Cliff Siegfried, State Museum  director. &ldquo;The recent discoveries that State Museum  scientists and their colleagues have made at this site have advanced our  understanding of life in a world hundreds of millions of years in the past.  We&rsquo;re excited to be able to enhance our collections documenting these  discoveries and want to acknowledge and thank DEP for partnering with us to  make it possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. William Stein, associate professor of biology at the State University  at Binghamton  and a co-author of the <em>Nature</em> article, noted that there are still many unanswered questions about the trees  and their stumps. A paleobotanist who specializes in the Devonian period, Stein  said that the new additions to the Museum collection are important because they  will allow him to analyze multiple specimens of different sizes, including some  that appear deformed, to learn more about how these plants grew and interacted  with their environment. </p>
<p>The most recent discovery  of Gilboa stump specimens was made in  the old Riverside Quarry in Schoharie   County. Some of the DEP  engineers at the site were familiar with the history of the area as a fossil  site and were interested in helping to recover any fossils that might turn up as  they excavated infill from the old quarry in the process of rebuilding the dam.  The same quarry was used as a source of face rock when the former City of New  York Board of Water Supply began constructing the Gilboa Dam in 1919. There, in  1920, workers discovered casts of fossil tree stumps in the positions in which  they were originally growing. As with  the most recent discovery, the State   Museum was notified and  the fossils were placed in the Museum&rsquo;s paleontology collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These unique discoveries from the site of our  $350 million reconstruction of the Gilboa Dam help to tell the story of how the  Schoharie Valley was formed,&rdquo; said Paul Rush, deputy  commissioner of the Bureau of Water Supply for the New York City Department of  Environmental Protection. &ldquo;We are thrilled to be able to work with the New York State Museum  to showcase these fossils to foster a better understanding of the geologic history  of the watershed that provides drinking water to half the state&rsquo;s population.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> The  Gilboa Dam is part of New York City&rsquo;s Catskill  water supply system, and is located at the northern point of the Schoharie  Reservoir in the Town of Gilboa.  The reconstruction of the dam started with emergency stabilization work in  2005. The upgrade will extend the useful life of the dam for 50 to 100 years and bring it into  compliance with the latest state and federal standards. This includes an  enhanced capacity to safely release water in the event of a dam safety  emergency&mdash;a design feature critical to protecting the dam and communities  downstream. The work is scheduled to be completed in 2016. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Some  of the recently discovered stumps will remain on the Gilboa construction site  for future placement elsewhere. DEP also is donating five of the stumps to the Gilboa Museum,  which plans to hold an open house to unveil its new acquisitions on July 10.  The Museum houses many rare fossils found only in the Gilboa area. It also  contains artifacts and photos from the original town of Gilboa  before it was transformed into a reservoir for New York City&rsquo;s drinking water. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to their  scientific significance, the <em>Eospermatopteris </em>stumps also have profound  cultural and historical significance to the State of New York,&rdquo; said Stein. &ldquo;The building of the  Gilboa Dam and the old village   of Gilboa, now under the  waters of Schoharie Reservoir, are history well worth cherishing. Properly  conserved and protected, the stumps are a powerful reminder, and useful  teaching tool.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The State Museum  is a program of the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural  Education. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating  state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is  open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is closed on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be  obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
