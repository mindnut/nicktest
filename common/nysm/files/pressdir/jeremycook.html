<p>ALBANY,  N.Y. &ndash; The New York State Museum&rsquo;s annual &ldquo;Cooking the Tree of Life&rdquo; evolution  program on February 8 will focus this year on the evolution of milk and offer  samples of the popular foods that have resulted. </p>
<p> The program, at 7 p.m. in the Clark  Auditorium, celebrates the 203rd anniversary of the birth of Charles  Darwin, who laid the foundations of the theory of evolution. It will explore the  evolutionary origins of the foods we consume, and the ways that human cultures  have taken species from the wild and modified them through selective breeding  over thousands of generations to suit our nutritional needs and epicurean  desires. Audience members will be able  to taste samples prepared by local food experts and learn about the natural  history of some of America&rsquo;s  favorite foods.</p>
<p> Dr.  Jeremy Kirchman, the State   Museum&rsquo;s evolutionary  biologist, will lead the presentation, and Dr. Reid Ivy, creamery manager for the  award-winning Old Chatham Sheepherding Co, will explain how cheese is made.  Together they will consider the evolution of mammals, milk production, and the ingenious  ways that humans (with help from bacteria) have used this mammalian adaptation  to create some of our richest culinary pleasures. Dr. Ivy and Drue Spallholz from Albany&rsquo;s Honest Weight  Food Co-op, will lead the audience in a cheese tasting. </p>
<p>Lynn  Beaumont from Albany&rsquo;s  Cheesecake Machismo will be on hand to describe how to make cheesecake, and  will offer the audience samples of cheesecake made at her shop. Fresh local  milk from Clarksville&rsquo;s  Meadowbrook Farms Dairy will also be available for sampling. </p>
<p>There will be a $5 admission fee. Beer and  wine will be available for purchase.</p>
