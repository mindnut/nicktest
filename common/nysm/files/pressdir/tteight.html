<p>ALBANY &mdash; Time Tunnel, New York State Museum&rsquo;s 20th annual summer day camp, under way now through August 15, still has openings available for all three sessions. </p>
<p>The camp is open to children entering first through eight grades. It is divided into three two-week sessions, each with a different theme. Participants can register for one of the sessions or for the entire program. A limited number of one-week sessions are also available. </p>
<p> Time Tunnel offers a diverse approach to learning in the creative environment of a natural history museum. A staff of educators, scientists, artists, counselors and outstanding college students work together to provide day campers with summer activities that are both fun and educational. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Born to Build: Nature&rsquo;s Construction Crews&rdquo; is the theme for the first session that runs from July 7-18. Through the lens of a natural history museum, campers will explore the ways in which the world is constantly changing. Campers will explore sculptures and monuments. They also will be able to test their skills by building skyscrapers and bridges made with building blocks, toothpicks, marshmallows and cardboard tubes. </p>
<p>The second session, July 21 through August 1, will focus on &ldquo;Invaders of the Lost Ark: Borders, Boundaries and Beyond&rdquo; Campers will learn about strange alien species that threaten the ecosystem and construct masks and &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo; posters to help educate each other on these pesky invaders. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Beasts; Itty-Bitty, Immense and Imaginary Creatures&rdquo; will be the topic of the third session, August 4-5. Campers will explore the museum&rsquo;s vast collection of animals and insects and learn about a wide array of creatures, both alive and extinct. Young scientists will be able to utilize their knowledge of animal life and a bit of creativity to make their own creatures and stories. </p>
<p>There is a fee for this program. For more information or to register call (518) 402-5019. </p>
