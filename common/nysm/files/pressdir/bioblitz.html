<p>Scientists from the New York State Museum will play central roles in the 6th annual BioBlitz, to be held in New York City's Central Park from noon Friday, June 27 to noon, Saturday June 28.</p>
<p>The New York State Biodiversity Research Institute at the New York State Museum is one of the principal organizers of the BioBlitz, which is a 24-hour exploration and inventory of biological resources throughout Central Park. Teams of scientists and naturalists with expertise in various animal and plant groups, aided by a cadre of volunteers, will comb the park's 843 acres, observing and recording as many species as possible during the 24-hour time period. </p>
<p> Another goal of the annual BioBlitz is to educate the public about the variety of wildlife and plant life that exists virtually in their own backyards and, in this case, an urban environment. As recently as July 2002 scientists from the American Museum of Natural History discovered a new genus and species of centipede in Central Park.</p>
<p>	Dr. Roland Kays, the State Museum's curator of mammals, will be the leader coordinating the mammal survey at the BioBlitz. He will use live traps and several camera traps to survey some of the park's mammals. Kays studies the distribution of carnivores in Albany's Pine Bush and in the Adirondacks. His research looks at how disturbances, such as development, agriculture and hunting, affect survival.  </p>
<p>	Ronald Gill, a biodiversity research specialist at the State Museum, will be one of the principal coordinators of the event. He will be working with the BioBlitz committee to assign scientists and volunteers to survey teams that will work for 4-hour shifts during the 24-hour time period.  Gill will also work with other committee members to compile a list of the total number of species recorded during the event.
This year's BioBlitz is one of the official events being held in conjunction with the celebration of the 150th anniversary of Central Park.  The park covers 843 acres and has a perimeter of six miles. Within this area are 150 acres of waterbodies, 250 acres of lawns and 136 acres of woodlands. When the park was completed in 1878, more than 4 million trees, shrubs and plants, representing more than 1,400 species, had been planted to create the foundation for the park.</p>
<p>The Explorers Club is organizing the event in cooperation with the following organizations:</p>
<p>The NYS Biodiversity Research Institute at the New York State Museum, The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation of the American Museum of Natural History, The Central Park Conservancy, the New York City Audubon Society and Department of Parks and Recreation, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Wildlife Trust.</p>
<p>The State Museum, a cultural program of the New York State Department of Education, was founded on a tradition of scientific inquiry. Started in 1836, the museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research and collection survey in the United States. The museum is located on Madison Avenue in Albany.
