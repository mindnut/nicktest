<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Biodiversity Research Institute  (BRI) and the New York State Museum  will present weekly lectures in October focusing on recent biodiversity  research, conservation and education initiatives in New York State. </p>
<p> All lectures are free and will be held on  Wednesdays at noon in the Huxley Theater. The lecturers will focus on the  results of research that was funded by the New York State Biodiversity Research  Institute. Lecture topics and  dates are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>October       7 &ndash; &ldquo;White-nose Syndrome: The Darkest of Nights for North American Bats.&rdquo; During       the winter of 2005&ndash;2006, a disease appeared in a Schoharie County       cave that has nearly eliminated bats that winter in the Northeast.       Twenty-five of the 45 bat species in the United States may be at risk,       with extinctions being a real possibility. Alan Hicks, from New York State&rsquo;s endangered species program,       will discuss the history, current status, and future conservation efforts       regarding this unprecedented problem.</li>
  <li>October       14 &ndash; &ldquo;Impacts to Wildlife from the Consequences of Exurban Development in       the Adirondack        Park.&rdquo; Large-scale       fragmentation resulting from large lot development outside incorporated       cities and towns may decrease biotic integrity, alter species behavior and       composition, and increase human-wildlife conflict. Dr. Michale Glennon, a       scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society&rsquo;s Adirondack Program, will       discuss her work to understand the responses of avian communities       surrounding residential homes in the Adirondacks.</li>
  <li>October       21 &ndash; &ldquo;Benthic Biodiversity in the Great South Bay:       Effects of Hard Clam (<em>Mercenaria       mercenaria</em>) Restoration.&rdquo; The Nature Conservancy has created hard clam       spawner sanctuaries to restore hard clams, <em>Mercenaria mercenaria</em>, to Long Island&rsquo;s Great        South Bay. Michael Doall, of the Functional Ecology Lab in       the Ecology and Evolution Department at Stony Brook        University,will discuss the impacts of  increasing hard clam populations on benthic biodiversity and examines ecosystem  benefits of hard clam restoration efforts.</li>
  <li>October       28 &ndash; &ldquo;Forgotten Floras: Making the Case for Vouchered Plant Collections.&rdquo; In       2004, a species-area curve analysis revealed that at least 10 counties in       the state documented fewer than half the plant species than predicted.       Five years later, Otsego, Montgomery and Fulton counties were surveyed,       generating more than 1,000 new records, including several rare and some       newly invasive plants. Dr. Donna Vogler, of the State University of New       York College at Oneonta, will discuss the major findings of those efforts       and the role of voucher-based natural history collections in the       increasingly molecular and digital world of biology.</li>
</ul>
<p>The New  York State Legislature created the Biodiversity Research Institute in 1993 to  help meet the challenges associated with preserving the state&rsquo;s  biodiversity. The BRI serves as a  comprehensive source of information,  which is used to advise both public and private agencies on matters relating to  the status of New York&rsquo;s  biological resources. Housed within the New York State Museum,  the BRI is funded through the Environmental Protection Fund. The BRI includes several collaborators,  including the State Museum, the New York Natural Heritage Program,  Audubon New York,  the state Department of Environmental Conservation, the state Office of Parks,  Recreation and Historic Preservation and The Nature Conservancy. Further information is available at: <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri/">http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri/</a> or by  calling (518) 474-6531. </p>
<p> The State Museum  is a program of the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural  Education. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating  state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located  on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be  obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
