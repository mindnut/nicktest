		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> Prior to the film&rsquo;s official release on national public television and on WMHT locally in December, the environmental group Hudson Riverkeeper has teamed up with Moira Productions, the film&rsquo;s producer, to organize screenings of the documentary in Hudson River towns and cities this fall. The tour, which includes screenings, special presentations, and audience discussions, provides an opportunity to support groups along the river that are dedicated to helping protect the environment.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> At the Museum&rsquo;s free screening at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Director Tom Weidlinger will discuss what he has learned about the river during the two years that he&rsquo;s spent on this project, as well as the challenges that lie ahead. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The film chronicles Christopher Swain&rsquo;s 36-day swim of the 315-mile length of the Hudson River in the summer of 2004. Swain, of Colchester, Vt., braved whitewater, sewage, snapping turtles, hydroelectric dams, homeland security patrols, factory outfalls, and PCB contamination to become the first person to swim the entire length of the Hudson River from the Adirondack Mountains to New York City. Swain&rsquo;s mission was to advocate for a cleaner river that is safe for drinking and swimming.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The project went far beyond the filming of the swim itself. In the film, Swain&rsquo;s experience links together stories of the river, which begins in the Adirondack wilderness and ends in one of the nation&rsquo;s densest population centers. Included are interviews with those who are fighting to protect the Hudson against a range of threats from industry, inept regulatory agencies, and public indifference.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> In the film, the epic of the 19th century destruction and redemption of the Adirondacks complements the modern-day story of citizens fighting to block the building of a huge trash plant that would burn one quarter of New York City&rsquo;s garbage. It shows Riverkeeper battling the Exxon Mobil </p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> The film also features folk singer Pete Seeger who talks about his efforts to draw attention to the river through his trips on the sloop Clearwater. It also focuses on ordinary citizens who are making a difference through choices they make that affect the environment. </p>
