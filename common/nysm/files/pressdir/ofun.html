<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Fire safety is the theme of the New York State Museum&rsquo;s next Family Fun Weekend, Oct. 6 &ndash; 7.<br />
    <br />
  The Family Fun Weekend, presented by Fidelis Care, takes place from 1 &ndash; 4 p.m. both days. Activities, which are free of charge, are held in and around Fire Engine Hall, on the Museum&rsquo;s first floor.</p>
<p> On Saturday, the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control will open its Fire Safety House, which provides hands-on learning for children and their parents. The house, which will be located just outside the Museum, is furnished with a kitchen, living room and bedroom, where families can identify fire hazards and correct them. A working telephone system will even enable them to make a sample call to a 911 dispatcher, and practice providing all of the necessary information. </p>
<p> From 2 to 3 p.m. on Saturday, &ldquo;Mr. Stop, Drop &amp; Roll&rdquo; will walk around the Museum to hand out stickers and demonstrate safety tips.</p>
<p> Throughout the afternoon both days, fire safety movies -- &ldquo;Safe at Home- Fire Safety Check List&rsquo;&rsquo; and &ldquo;Kids and Smoke Detector Response&rsquo;&rsquo; -- will play continuously. Children can cut and color a Dalmatian to take home, and attach fasteners so that the legs move. There will be a scavenger hunt, with prizes, and an activity packet to take home filled with coloring sheets, puzzles, word searches and other activities. </p>
<p> Family Fun Weekends, presented by Fidelis Care, offer theme-based family activities and are held the first weekend of the month. <br />
