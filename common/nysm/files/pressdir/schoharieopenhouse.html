<div id="main"> 
<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; On July 5-6 the public is invited to tour an active archaeological dig in Schoharie County and see some of the 200,000  artifacts that have been uncovered at the prehistoric site, which dates to 2000  B.C.</p>
<p> The New York  State Museum and the University at Albany&rsquo;s Anthropology Department will host the  7th annual open house from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. both days at the  Pethick site on Smith Road, off of Route 7/30A in the Village of Central  Bridge. Cooking hearths,  storage pits and other food processing areas have been found at the site. The  majority of the artifacts date to the Late Woodland period (900-1500 A.D.) and  Early Woodland period (1000 B.C.- 1 A.D.) but  additional evidence suggests that the location has been occupied frequently  dating back to at least 2000 B.C. </p>
<p> State  Archaeologist Dr. Christina Rieth of the New York State   Museum and Dr. Sean  Rafferty, associate professor of Anthropology at the University at Albany, will  discuss New York State Archaeology and the relationship of the Pethick site to  other nearby sites in the Schoharie Valley, as well as to prior excavations  conducted by archaeologists nearby. They also will discuss how artifacts found  at this site are similar to or different from other sites of similar age and  how landscape features, such as the Schoharie Creek, have played an important  role in the occupation of the site.</p>
<p> Students  from the University at Albany&rsquo;s  Anthropology Department will provide tours of the site and active excavation  areas, but visitors are welcome to explore at their own pace and stay as long  as they would like.</p>
<p> The privately-owned site is in its  eighth season of excavation and is the home of an eight-week Archaeology field  school for both undergraduate and graduate students. As part of the field  school, students preserve and catalogue the artifacts, which will ultimately  become part of the Museum&rsquo;s collections. </p>
<p>The State Museum  is a program of the State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education.  Located on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on  Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free, Further information  can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the Museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
