<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - The New York State Museum will be hosting the 10th anniversary of its 
annual celebration of flowers known as <em>New York in Bloom,</em> a fund-raiser for its after-school 
programs, the Museum Club and the Discovery Squad. <em>New York in Bloom</em> will be open to the 
public from <strong>10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday, February 23, and 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, 
February 24 and Sunday, February 25.</strong></p>
   <p>An event that continues to grow in stature and significance with each passing year, <em> New York 
in Bloom</em> is one of the most heavily attended of the Museum's annual programs and a tradition 
in the community. It consists of elaborate, inventive floral arrangements by garden club members 
and amateur and professional designers from across the state. Participants in the event attempt to 
create arrangements that will thematically complement and even enhance the Museum's 
exhibitions.</p>
<p>This year's contributors face the challenge of tying arrangements in with <em>Berenice 
Abbott's Changing New York,</em> a display of photographs that document Depression-era New York 
City, and <em>The Great New York Motorcycle Show,</em> an exhibition of classic motorcycles dating 
from the 1890s to the present.</p> 
<p>The Museum Club combines a commitment to underserved children in the City of Albany 
with hands-on, interactive learning opportunities that are facilitated by Museum staff and teenage 
assistants known as the Discovery Squad. The Museum Club and Discovery Squad programs 
offer educational enrichment, tutoring, behind-the-scenes views of Museum exhibitions and, for 
the teens, opportunities to work with scientists and other professionals as they prepare for 
college. The Museum Club/Discovery Squad program has been nationally recognized by the 
President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities as a "model program serving underserved 
youth during the after school hours."</p>
<p>Mayor Gerald D. Jennings is the Honoree for this extra special 10th year event. The Mayor 
and his wife, Mary Ann, will serve as Honorary Chairpersons. </p>
<p>"Mary Ann and I are honored to serve as this year's Honorary Chairs of <em>New York in 
Bloom,</em>" Mayor Jennings said. "The availability of after school programs for our underserved 
youth is of great importance to us and this event brings the tremendous educational resources of 
the Museum to these young people through the Museum Club and Discovery Squad programs. 
We are grateful to all of you who support it. We particularly want to thank the Museum staff that 
develop and administer these outstanding programs."</p>
<p>There will be a gala dinner reception at <strong> 6:30 p.m. on Friday, February 23,</strong> with cocktails 
and catering provided by the Glen Sanders Mansion. Valet parking will be available; black tie 
optional. The public may call (518) 474-0068 for reservations by <strong>February 15.</strong></p>
<p>The admission fee is $2 for adults. Children under 12 and accompanied by an adult will be 
admitted free. Tickets for <strong>New York in Bloom</strong> may be purchased at the door.</p>
