<p>The New York State Museum will be closed to the public on Saturday, April 26th and Sunday, April 27th so that repairs can be made to electrical equipment that controls the power in the building. </p>
<p>The Museum will reopen Monday, April 28 at 9:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Similar repairs were made to the west side of the building requiring a partial shutdown of the museum March 22-23. During the weekend of April 26-27th repairs will be made to the east side of the building. However, this time the power outage is expected to be more widespread affecting all of the museum's restrooms, as well as the lobby and most galleries. </p>
