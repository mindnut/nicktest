<p>ALBANY, NEW YORK &ndash; The New York  State Museum has launched a new statewide website and facebook page dedicated  to commemorating the bicentennial of the War of 1812.</p>
<p> The website <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/Warof1812/">http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/Warof1812/</a> will  include a web-based exhibition and be a statewide clearinghouse for information  about New York&rsquo;s pivotal role in the War of  1812, as well as for all War of 1812 events across New   York State and into Canada.  The goal is to provide a site for conversation and coordination among all of  those interested in commemorating the memory of the war. </p>
<p> To  complement this website, there is a special facebook page at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/N.Y.1812">http://www.facebook.com/N.Y.1812</a> dedicated  to posting upcoming events found on the War of 1812 website, as well as links  for collections, artifacts and resources related to the War. </p>
<p>The New  York-Canadian border was the central front of the war, which was waged against  the British Empire from June 18, 1812 to  February 18, 1815. Some of the nation&rsquo;s most prominent military figures of the  early 19th century made their names along New York State&rsquo;s  northern frontier. Several pivotal battles also took place in the state,  including the battle of Plattsburgh  in September 1814.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The War of 1812 is a &lsquo;New York story&rsquo; and so too is our effort to  commemorate this important bicentennial,&rdquo; said Museum Director Mark Schaming.  &ldquo;We have reached out to historians, historical societies and various other  collaborators and partners across the state and into Canada, inviting them to join with  us in telling this story and making this the &lsquo;go-to&rsquo; place to learn about the  war and the many events planned to commemorate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  website will be a growing and evolving statewide resource for the duration of  the bicentennial commemorations. Interested historians &ndash; from academics to genealogists  &ndash; will have an opportunity to submit 1812-related stories, whether they are  biographies of local citizens or essays on New York-related events. A page  devoted to biographies highlights valiant and patriotic men and women who  contributed their time, energies, and in some cases, made the ultimate  sacrifice to aid the war effort. </p>
<p>The site also provides a platform for  historical societies and museums across the state to highlight their War of 1812  collections in a virtual artifact gallery. The site currently displays historic  artifacts related to the War that are in the collections of the State Museum,  State Library and State Archives. </p>
<p>A resources page lists website links for War of 1812  commemorative events and organizations, as well as for State Library resources  and State Archives records. </p>
<p>The State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is open  Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be  obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the Museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
