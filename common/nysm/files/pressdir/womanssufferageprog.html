<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A Charlton writer and regional historian will  speak and sign copies of her new book, &ldquo;<em>Strength Without Compromise: Womanly Influence and Political Identity in  Turn-of-the-Twentieth Century Rural Upstate New York&rdquo;</em> at the New York State  Museum on Sunday, April18.</p>
<p>Teri Gay will present the free program  at 1 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. Her book covers 30 years of research in Warren, Washington and Saratoga counties. It details  the untold history of the rural suffrage movement, highlighting the ladies of  the Easton Political Equality Club and how they embraced their femininity and  womanly influence to win the vote in New    York State  in 1917. Susan B. Anthony and other  noted suffragists of the tri-county region are also featured in this book.  Copies will be available for purchase following the presentation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay has long had an interest in  women&rsquo;s rights and suffrage. Born and raised in Glens Falls, she has also  lectured and written articles about industrial history, artists and sculptors  of the Adirondacks, 19th century reformist movements, the  Underground Railroad, and historic preservation. She is the former Malta historian  and author/editor of &ldquo;<em>Malta Memories</em>,&rdquo; published in 2007.</p>
<p>The program is being held in conjunction with  the Museum&rsquo;s current exhibition, &ldquo;<em>Women  Who Rocked the Vote</em>,&rdquo; on display in the lobby. The exhibition, which opened  in March to celebrate Women&rsquo;s History Month, honors the grassroots suffrage  activities of the state and showcases the wagon used by Long   Island suffragist Edna Kearns. </p>
