<p style="text-align:justify;">An exhibition featuring the work and philosophy of renowned  industrial designer Russel Wright will open May 4, 2013 at the New York State  Museum. <em>Russel Wright: The Nature of  Design </em>explores Wright's career from the 1920s through the 1970s and features  approximately 40 objects along with photographs and design sketches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On display through December 31 in the Crossroads Gallery, the  exhibit was first organized by and presented at the  Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art at the State University of New York at New Paltz  from August 2012 to March 2013.&nbsp;The exhibit includes  objects such as wood serving bowls and spun aluminum trays designed Pre-World  War II as well as Wright&rsquo;s more experimental and innovative Post-World War II  designs, including earthenware plates, bowls, pitchers, and vases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The exhibit also includes a video with images created by  Wright to explain his conception of Manitoga, his final home and estate and now  a national historic landmark, located in Garrison, New York. Built into an  abandoned stone quarry, the modernist home and 75 acre garden was Wright&rsquo;s most  inventive and holistic realization of his philosophy and goal to live in  harmony with nature and good design.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Russel Wright (1904-1976) revolutionized the American home  and the way people lived there. His inexpensive, mass-produced dinnerware, furniture,  appliances and textiles were not only 
  visually and technically innovative, but were also the tools to achieve his  concept of &quot;easier living,&quot; a unique American lifestyle that was  gracious yet contemporary and informal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collaborating with his wife Mary Wright, Russel disseminated  his designs and ideas in exhibitions, books, articles, advertisements, radio  interviews, and demonstration rooms in department stores. In all these  enterprises, Russel and Mary converted his name and signature into a  recognizable trademark on par with major manufacturers. They invented lifestyle  marketing centered on a compelling persona, paving the way for such lifestyle  interpreters as Martha Stewart and Ralph Lauren. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The exhibit is accompanied by a fully-illustrated catalogue  featuring essays by co-curators Donald Albrecht and Dianne Pierce and by Kerry  Dean Carso, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Art History at the State University  of New York at New Paltz. The catalogue also includes images and text from Russel  Wright&rsquo;s 1960 slide talk, which promoted his philosophy of modern living and  the importance of maintaining a close relationship to nature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Donald Albrecht has curated exhibitions that have ranged from  overviews of cultural trends, including World War II and the American Dream and  Green House: New Directions in Sustainable Architecture and Design for the  National Building Museum, the National Design Triennial for the Cooper-Hewitt  National Design Museum, and Paris/New York: Design Fashion Culture, 1925&ndash;1940  for the Museum of the City of New York. Albrecht teaches in the Masters Program  in the Decorative Arts at the Cooper-Hewitt and lectures frequently about  architecture and design at other institutions. He is a Fellow of the American  Academy in Rome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dianne Pierce is the former Museum Education Director at  Manitoga/The Russel Wright Design Center. She is an adjunct faculty member,  teaching the history of design, in the Department of Art History at the State  University of New York at New Paltz as well as faculty at Parsons The New  School of Design in New York.</p>
