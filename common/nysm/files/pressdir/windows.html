<p>ALBANY -- Windows on New York, the state Museum's newest gallery with an exhibition 
featuring spectacular collections from across New York <strong>opens Friday, November 23</strong>.</p>
<p> Recent events have led to postponement of the formal opening scheduled for November 3. That 
celebration, a day of music and cultural programs, will take place in the spring. 
But starting on the 23rd, the day after Thanksgiving, the 25,000 square-foot Windows on New York 
will be open, including the marquee attraction, <strong>The New York State Museum Carousel</strong>, a fully 
restored, working carousel that operated in the state from 1916 to 1972. </p>
<p>  <strong>Windows on New York</strong>, as well as the first floor galleries of the Museum, will be open daily from <strong>9:30 am - 5:00p</strong>m.
A new café: New York State Fare, will open along with the new Windows exhibit, all on the
Museum's 4th floor Terrace Gallery Space.</p>
<p>  Occupying the dramatic fourth-floor Terrace Gallery, Windows on New York is laid out to 
orient visitors to the Museum and to the state. For instance, collections devoted to Western New 
York occupy the western portion of the gallery; Long Island faces south and the Hudson Valley, 
east. The new gallery highlights as well the Finger Lakes and the Southern Tier; the Mohawk 
Valley and The Erie Canal; the North and New York City</p>
