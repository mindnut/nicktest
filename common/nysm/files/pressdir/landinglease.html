<title>STATE PALEONTOLOGIST REPORTS MAJOR DISCOVERY IN GEOLOGY</title>

<p>ALBANY, NY -- New York State Paleontologist Dr.  Ed Landing is the lead author of an article published in the June issue of &ldquo;<em>Geology&rdquo; </em>that provides the first definitive  proof that all major animal groups with internal and external skeletons appeared in the Cambrian geological period (543&ndash;489  million years ago). </p>
<p>At this time in Earth&rsquo;s history all  plants and animals lived in the sea and advanced groups, such as fresh-water  and land plants and vertebrates (e.g., amphibians, reptiles, mammals), had not  evolved yet.<strong> </strong>Landing discovered fossils of a major, colonial,  reef-building group of animals known as bryozoans in Cambrian rocks of southern  Mexico.  At c.490 million years old, theseare Earth's oldest known  bryozoans, and are eight million years older than forms described in 2003<strong> </strong>from southern China. </p>
<p>The  exquisite preservation of the tiny<strong> </strong>Mexican bryozoans (most occur as fragments  only several millimeters long) suggests that highly mineralized, twig-like  bryozoan coloniesevolved fromsoft-bodied colonies that were  attached to shells and pebbles on the sea floor. The twig-like  formelevated the colony above the sea floor, and allowed feeding inhigher  energy and more food-rich waters above the sea floor.</p>
<p>Landing and  his co-authors propose that thealmost simultaneous first-occurrences of  bryozoans, cephalopods (ancient squid relatives), polyplacophorans (chitons)  and euconodonts (fish-like vertebrates), about 490 million years ago,marked  a key stage in the origin of complex marine animal communities that resemble  those of modern oceans. </p>
<p> The  field work in Mexico,  which led to the discovery, was made possible by a $900 grant Landing received  from the Rockland County Gem and Mineral Society when it closed its doors.</p>
<p> The &ldquo;<em>Geology</em>&rdquo; article is available at <a href="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/38/6/547.full">http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/38/6/547.full</a>. &ldquo;Geology&rdquo; features rapid publication of about 23 refereed short  (four-page) papers each month. Articles cover all earth-science disciplines and  include new investigations and provocative topics. </p>
<p>The article&rsquo;s other  co-authors are Dr. John  D. Keppie of the Institute   of Geology, Independent National University of Mexico and Adam English, now affiliated with the  Chevron Gulf of Mexico Business Unit.</p>
<p> The state paleontologist and curator  of paleontology at the State   Museum since 1981,  Landing has authored six books, 13 New York State   Museum bulletins, 200  articles and field trip guides and has received more than a dozen competitive  grants. </p>
<p>He has devoted five National Science  Foundation grants, totaling about $1.5 million, to tracing the evolutionary  origins of modern marine groups worldwide. In 2009 Landing was  elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences  (AAAS), a high honor bestowed upon a select group of geologists nationwide.  Fellows are recognized by their peers for meritorious efforts to advance  science or its applications. In 2008, he was the first U.S. recipient  of the R. J. W. Douglas Medal &mdash; a national award that honors contributions to  the synthesis of Canadian geology. </p>
<p>Landing became interested in Early  Paleozoic rocks and fossils as an undergraduate at the University of  Wisconsin-Madison. He earned his master&rsquo;s and Ph.D. at the University of Michigan.  He has conducted post-doctoral studies at the University  of Waterloo, with the United States  Geological Survey in Denver and at the University of Toronto. </p>
<p>The New York State Museum  is a program of the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural  Education. Founded in 1836, the museum has the longest continuously operating  state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. The State Museum  is located on Madison Avenue in Albany.  It is open daily from 9:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and  New Year&rsquo;s Day. Further information can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877  or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
