<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; The next exhibition in the Bank of America&rsquo;s Great Art Series -- <em>Rockwell Kent:  This is My Own &ndash; </em>opens at the New    York State Museum on November 22.</p>
<p> On view  through May 17, 2009 in the Museum&rsquo;s West Gallery, the exhibition is the 20th  installment of the Bank of America Great Art Exhibition and Education Program,  which brings works from New York State&rsquo;s leading art museums and collections to the State Museum.  This exhibition will feature works from the collection of the Plattsburgh State  Art Museum, State University of New York at Plattsburgh, the most complete and  balanced collection of Kent&rsquo;s work in the United States. The collection was  established by a gift and bequest from Kent&rsquo;s wife, Sally Kent Gorton. This  exhibition is curated by Cecilia M. Esposito, director of the Plattsburgh State   Art Museum.</p>
<p> &quot;We at Plattsburgh,  and I as a Regent, are delighted to share the life work of Rockwell Kent with visitors to the New York State   Museum from across the state  and the nation,&rdquo; said James Dawson, member of the State Board of Regents. &ldquo;This  powerful and unique exhibition will give visitors an opportunity to engage  with, and understand, the life and artistic contributions of Rockwell Kent to American  art. As a faculty member at the State University of Plattsburgh, I have been  familiar with the Kent Collection for decades. So, I am delighted to see that  others in the state and nation will have this same profound opportunity to  share in Kent's  incredible artistic talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p> A critically  acclaimed artist who provided the illustrations for such classics as &ldquo;<em>Moby Dick</em>&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<em>Canterbury Tales</em>,&rdquo; Kent succeeded in multiple endeavors during his  lifetime. He was a painter, muralist, illustrator, printmaker, book designer,  graphic artist, architect, builder, writer and editor, lecturer, navigator,  world traveler and political and social activist. </p>
<p> Kent once said  that &ldquo;art is no more than the shadow cast by a man&rsquo;s own stature.&rdquo; This  exhibition is unique in the breadth of materials on display, including hundreds  of items that chronicle Kent&rsquo;s  life and work, reflecting remarkable personal experiences and a deep sense of  moral and political principle. On display are paintings, drawings, prints,  books, bookplates, photographs, dinnerware, advertising art and more. &ldquo;<em>Rockwell Kent</em>,&rdquo;  a documentary produced by Frederick Lewis, and the book, &ldquo;<em>Rockwell Kent:  The Art of the Bookplate&rdquo;</em> will be for sale in the Museum Shop.</p>
<p> Born in  Tarrytown in 1882, Kent  experienced a comfortable, upper middle-class lifestyle until the sudden death  of his father in 1887. As a young boy he developed a resilience and remarkable  work ethic that was evident in all of his future endeavors. </p>
<p> From 1900  through 1902, while studying architecture at Columbia University in New York  City, Kent attended painter William Merritt Chase&rsquo;s summer school for art at  Shinnecock Hills, Long Island. He changed his studies to painting and continued  classes with Chase in New York.  He spent the summer of 1903 with artist Abbott H. Thayer in New Hampshire. Bolstered by the sale of two  paintings he quit Columbia  and enrolled in the New York School of Art, where he was instructed by Robert  Henri, the leader of what is now known as the &ldquo;Ashcan School.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Kent  achieved both critical and financial success as an artist during the 1920s and  1930s. He became well-known for his book illustrations, bookplates and  commercial work. Private collectors and major museums, including the  Metropolitan Museum of Art, acquired his paintings and prints. </p>
<p> Between 1918  and 1935, Kent  traveled to remote parts of the world, often staying for long periods of time  to learn about the people who lived there and to express and record his  experiences through his paintings and books. </p>
<p>In 1915, during World War I, he was  ordered to leave Newfoundland  over fears that he was a German spy. While in Newfoundland he painted one of his major  works, &ldquo;<em>House of Dread</em>.&rdquo; In Alaska,  as in other countries he visited, Kent demonstrated his building  skills, renovating an abandoned goat shed and turning it into a comfortable  home. &ldquo;<em>Wilderness: A Journal of Quiet Adventure in Alaska&rdquo;</em> chronicled his adventures there.  He also traveled to Tierra del Fuego, where he  wrote &ldquo;<em>Voyaging&rdquo; </em>about his dangerous travels  through the most exposed islands of the archipelago. &ldquo;<em>N by E&rdquo; </em>was about another  hair-raising adventure -- an ill-fated cruise he took to Greenland  in 1929. He returned to Greenland in 1931 where he wrote &ldquo;<em>Salamina</em>,&rdquo; named in honor of his housekeeper and mistress. Kent also  designed dinnerware by the same name. <br />
   Kent  purchased a dairy farm in the Adirondacks, outside of the village of Au Sable Forks,  in 1927 and named it Asgaard, meaning &ldquo;home of the gods.&rdquo; It served as his  retreat for the rest of his life.</p>
<p> From 1912 to  1968, Kent  practiced the time-honored art of the bookplate, creating more than 185  custom-designed bookplates in response to mail orders that came his way,  including one for Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.. He also pursued wood engraving, a passion  that rivaled his great love for painting. </p>
<p> Kent painted  several major murals during the 1930s and 40s. His designs for the 1939  Christmas Seals campaign were used on billboards, stamps and posters. During  this time, Kent  also produced political art, becoming very active in social and political  issues as a member of the Socialist Party he had joined in 1908. In 1953, he was summoned to appear before a  subcommittee, chaired by U.S. Senator </p>
<p>Joseph McCarthy, to answer questions about his membership in  the Communist Party. From 1957 to 1960, three major exhibitions of Kent&rsquo;s work were held in the Soviet   Union, and in 1960 he gave the country 80 canvases and 800  drawings and prints. He traveled to Moscow  in 1967 to accept the International Lenin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among  Peoples.</p>
<p> One of Kent&rsquo;s last  lucrative commercial contracts was with General Electric (GE). His painting of  a solitary farmhouse on a winter&rsquo;s night was reproduced in GE&rsquo;s 1946 calendar  and proved so popular that he was asked to provide another for the following  year. In January 1946, Kent  walked a picket line at GE in Schenectady  at the request of the striking workers there. GE officials were not pleased and  tried to cancel Kent&rsquo;s  contract but reneged after he threatened a lawsuit.</p>
<p> Kent died at  the age of 88 and is buried at Asgaard. His gravestone bears the title of his first  autobiography &ldquo;<em>This is My Own</em>,&rdquo; a  line taken from &ldquo;<em>Native</em><em> Land</em>,&rdquo;  a poem by Walter Scott. </p>
<p> On  February 14, from 1 to 3 p.m., the Museum will sponsor &ldquo;ARTventures,&rdquo; a program planned to  complement the Kent  exhibition<strong><em>. </em></strong>During a hands-on, art-making experience with instructor  Peggy Steinbach, participants will visit the exhibition and then create their  own interpretations in paint. Pre-registration is suggested. Call 518-473-7154  or e-mail <a href="mailto:psteinba@mail.nysed.gov">psteinba@mail.nysed.gov</a>.  The program is limited to 15 participants.
