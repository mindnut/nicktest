The exhibition is centered around three distinct, yet interrelated eras in Studio Museum history &ndash; the Harlem Renaissance, the politically and socially charged 1960s and 70s and the vibrant contemporary moment. Included are such works as James VanDerZee&rsquo;s iconic photographs of Harlem, Barkley Hendricks&rsquo; direct and unflinching portrait Lawdy Mama (1970) and recent artist-in-residence Adia Millett&rsquo;s intricate cross-stitches invoking memories of her father.</p>

It includes works created by artists during their residency at the Museum, as well as pieces given to the institution. The Studio Museum has a longstanding commitment to supporting established and emerging black artists. </p>
