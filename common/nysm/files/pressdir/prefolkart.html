<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - The biggest names in American folk art -- Rufus Hathaway, Edward Hicks, Joshua Johnson and Ammi Phillips -- will be featured at the New York State Museum in American Folk Art from The Metropolitan Museum of Art from Feb. 11 to April 23, 2000.</p>
<p>The exhibition in the West Gallery is the third installment in the Fleet Great Art Exhibition and Education Program.</p>
<p>"This exhibit celebrates the first time this important collection of folk paintings has been seen together outside the walls of The Metropolitan Museum of Art," said Mark Schaming, the State Museum's Director of Exhibitions. "Together these beautiful and iconic works transport us to 19th century America through the eyes of these wonderful artists."</p>
<p>The more than 50 works from The Metropolitan Museum's distinguished collection of American folk art include portraits, landscapes and historical and religious scenes. Featured are such canonical works as Lady with her Pets (1790) by Rufus Hathaway, Peaceable Kingdom (ca. 1830-32) by Edward Hicks, Falls of Niagara (1825) by Hicks and Mrs. Mayer and Daughter (1835-1840) by Ammi Phillips.</p>
<p>The precise nature of folk art has long been the subject of debate among art historians, critics, folklorists and collectors. The artists may have acquired their skills through apprenticeship, observation or informal learning. Their work adheres to the aesthetic standards of the communities in which they worked.</p>
<p>This exhibition was organized by Carrie Rebora Barratt, Associate Curator of American Paintings and Sculpture and Manager of The Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.  </p>
<p>The Fleet Great Art Series is made possible by a $450,000 donation from Fleet Financial Group. The Hearst Foundation Inc. has also given the State Museum a $100,000 grant to strengthen the program, which includes educational workshops for both students and adults. The State Museum, part of the State Education Department, is committed to lifelong learning for all New Yorkers.</p>
<p>State Sen. Roy M. Goodman, R-Manhattan, initiated these exhibitions by encouraging the partnership between the State Museum and the great art museums of New York City. Harry M. Rosenfeld, editor-at-large of the Times Union of Albany, was also instrumental in assisting the State Museum. Additional support comes from the Times Union, WNYT News Channel 13 and Lang Media.</p>
<p>Guided exhibit tours will be offered free to the public every weekend from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. through April 2 for American Folk Art. The tours are 30 minutes long and will be held every 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The State Museum is on Madison Avenue in downtown Albany. It is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. everyday except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.</p>
