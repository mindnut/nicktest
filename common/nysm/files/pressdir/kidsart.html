<p> <em>P.S. Art</em>, an exhibition of the best artwork from New York City's public schools, opens at the New York State Museum November 1.</p>
<p> The exhibition, at the entrance to Exhibition Hall through December 31, includes 47 works of art, including drawings and two-dimensional paintings, created by students in kindergarten through 12th grade.  Also included are the artists' reflections about their works and the processes by which they were generated.</p>
<p> The Alliance for Young Artists & Writers in New York City, co-sponsors of the exhibition, worked with the New York City Department of Education and asked public school arts coordinators to identify extraordinary art work from their schools. A panel of cultural leaders, assembled by Caroline Kennedy, selected the final works from nearly 300 that were submitted.</p>
<p> <em>P.S. Art</em> grew from another project of the Alliance. Following the September 11th tragedy, <em>ARTifacts: Kids Respond to a World in Crisis</em> demonstrated that many of New York City's young people found healing and hope through creative expression. Their compelling works of art also demonstrated the talent and resilience of New York City's students, in kindergarten through 12th grades. The Alliance was asked to work with the NYC Department of Education on P.S. Art as another way of showcasing the artwork of the city's students.</p>
<p> Albany is the last stop on a short tour of the exhibition. It opened at the DFN Gallery in Tribeca on May 2 to coincide with the Tribeca Film Festival and then moved to the Center for Arts Education's Gallery at 180 Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan.</p>
<p> The New York State Museum is located on Madison Avenue in Albany. It is open 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week throughout the year except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Further information about programs and events can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at www.nysm.nysed.gov.</p>
