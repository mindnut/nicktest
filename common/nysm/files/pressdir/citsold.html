<title>CITIZEN SOLDIER EXHIBITION OPENS MAY 28 AT NYS MUSEUM</title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY &ndash; As Memorial  Day approaches, an exhibition opens at the New York State   Museum May 28 recounting the  history of the New York National Guard and those who carried out its mission through  wars and battles, natural disasters and national emergencies. </p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Citizen Soldier: New York&rsquo;s National Guard in the American  Century&rdquo;</em> chronicles a history that is based on a tradition dating back to  colonial times in a state that has always been guided by the principle that its  defense lies in the hands of its citizenry. Citizen soldiers are everyday  people who put their lives on hold to defend, aid and protect their communities  and their country. From militiamen defending their homes on the colonial  frontier, to individuals serving in conflicts around the globe, New Yorkers  continue this legacy of service to the present day. </p>
<p>Open in  Exhibition Hall through March 2011, the exhibition features personal stories of soldiers from  across New York State  as well as mementos, uniforms, and artillery pieces from the State Museum, New  York State Military Museum, members of New    York&rsquo;s National Guard, and local collectors. Additional  support was received from Waste Management. </p>
<p>The exhibition focuses on the 20th  century, which witnessed the transformation of the United States from an isolationist  nation into a dominant power with the ability to shape world events. It was  dubbed the American Century in 1941 by Time Magazine Publisher Henry Luce.  During that time the National Guard evolved from an ill-equipped and poorly  trained militia into a modern-day force capable of protecting American  interests around the world. The 16,000 men and women who serve in the New York  Army National Guard today fulfill a variety of critical missions both at home  and abroad. </p>
<p>Encompassing nearly 7,000 square feet  of gallery space, the exhibition covers the service of New Yorkers in the  Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, the first Persian Gulf War in 1991  and the wars in Afghanistan  and Iraq.  Also included are the missions closer to home &ndash; the Capitol Fire (1911),  blizzards in Buffalo (1944, 1977) and New York City (1996), the Woodstock  concert (1969), the Attica riots (1971), the ice storm in northern New York (1998), the Mechanicville  tornado (1998), the 2001 terrorist attacks and other smaller calamities around  the state. </p>
<p>Visitors entering the exhibition will  see the M8 Greyhound Light Armored Car that was first introduced into combat in  1943. The 16,000-pound vehicle was used in all theaters of World War II,  including Europe, where it was issued to the  men of the 101st Cavalry Group of the New York National Guard. The  car is now owned by Gregory Wolanin of Loudonville. Also on display are a  flamethrower and bazooka, a 37 mm gun, as well as various other military  equipment. Visitors will also have the opportunity to see the History Channel  film, &ldquo;<em>Defending America,</em>&rdquo; which will  be shown in the gallery.</p>
<p>There are many personal stories of courage  and heroism throughout the exhibition. One of those is that of Sgt. Henry  Johnson of Albany, a member of the all-black 369th  Infantry Regiment who single-handedly fought off a group of German soldiers  before collapsing from 21 wounds during a battle in France in 1918. It wasn&rsquo;t until  1996 that Johnson was awarded the Purple Heart Medal, and 2003 when the Army  awarded him the Distinguished Service Cross, this nation&rsquo;s second highest award  for valor.</p>
<p>Medals of Honor, the nation&rsquo;s highest  military honor, were awarded to Col. William J. O&rsquo;Brien and Sgt. Thomas A.  Baker of Troy, both of the 105th  Infantry Regiment, for their courage in the face of a horrifying enemy attack  by the Japanese on Saipan in 1944. Also included is the story of Sgt. LeRoy  Sprague of Elmira of the 108th  Infantry Regiment who received a Purple Heart after being seriously wounded in  1945 during fighting on the island   of Luzon in the  Philippine Islands.</p>
<p> First Sgt.  James Meltz of Cropseyville, a member of the 108th Infantry  Regiment, received the Bronze Star for valor after rescuing fellow soldiers  from a burning humvee during a Taliban ambush in Afghanistan in 2008.</p>
<p> The  exhibition also features profiles of other members of the 108th  Infantry who served in Iraq,  including Sgt. 1st Class John Ross of Latham, Sgt. 1st  Class Luis Barsallo of Clifton Park and Private 1st Class Nathan Brown of  Glens Falls. Brown  was killed in Iraq  in 2004 when an insurgent fired a rocket-propelled grenade into the back of the  5-ton truck he was riding in. </p>
<p> Also  included in the exhibition are a bronze bust and other items related to Maj.  Gen. John Francis Ryan, who grew up in Morrisania, Westchester Co. and became  the commander of the New York </p>
<p>National Guard in 1912. He led the 27th Division  on the Mexican border and to victory in World War I.</p>
<p> A section of  the exhibition is devoted to women in the New York National Guard. Featured  here are profiles of Spc. Amy Klemm of Ronkonkoma,  who volunteered to serve in both Iraq  and Afghanistan, and Capt.  Tara Dawe of Queens, who volunteered for service in Bosnia  and later passed up Officer Candidate School  so that she could deploy with her unit, the 442nd MP Company, to Iraq. </p>
<p>The State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is open  daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's  Day. Admission is free.
