<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; More than 120 floral displays, food, entertainment and demonstrations will be among the attractions February 22-24 at the New York State Museum&rsquo;s 17th annual &ldquo;New York in Boom&rdquo; fund-raiser for its award-winning after-school programs.</p>
<p>Open from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday through Sunday, the event marks the only time during the year that admission is charged at the Museum. Proceeds benefit the Museum Club and Discovery Squad, the Museum&rsquo;s award-winning after-school programs. Garden club members, professional designers and floral enthusiasts from across the state will create unique floral arrangements that complement and interpret the museum&rsquo;s permanent and temporary exhibitions. </p>
<p>The admission fee for &ldquo;New York in Bloom&rdquo; is $4 for adults on Friday. On Saturday and Sunday the fee will be $6, which also includes admission to the 15th annual &ldquo;James Campbell Memorial Gem, Mineral and Fossil Show and Sale.&rdquo; Admission is free for children 12 and under, accompanied by an adult. Tickets may be purchased at the door. </p>
<p>The event will also feature table arrangements provided by local interior designers and home furnishing stylists, florists and event specialists. Demonstrations and children&rsquo;s activities will be featured all three days. </p>
<p>There also will be a fresh flower market in the Museum lobby, while supplies last, offering &ldquo;design your own bouquets&rdquo; and sales of individual roses, with flowers donated by Seagroatt Floral Co. Inc., Dan Engwer Wholesale and Seagroatt Riccardi, LTD. </p>
<p>Visitors will also see two floral projects created by Museum Club and Discovery Squad members. One will be located in the Black Capital Harlem in the 1920&rsquo;s gallery and will honor the late Martha Lewis of Albany, a former resident of Harlem. Lewis was a longtime volunteer for &ldquo;New York in Bloom,&rdquo; which often was held during the weekend of her birthday, February 24th. She devoted her life to working with young people and was an inspiration to the Museum Club students with whom she worked. Before her retirement, Lewis held several high-level governmental positions in the social and community service fields. The students will decorate a tree with flowers, photos of themselves and messages they write about other people in their lives, like Lewis, who have helped them &ldquo;bloom.&rdquo; Visitors will be invited to add their own messages to the tree.</p>
<p>The students&rsquo; other project will be located outside of the Look-Alikes: The Amazing World of Joan Steiner exhibition. Taking inspiration from the exhibition, the students will create a playground garden, incorporating real flowers with fantasy flowers created from everyday objects. &ldquo;Look-Alikes&rdquo; book author and artist Joan Steiner will also sign books outside of the exhibition. Books may be purchased in the Museum Shop.</p>
<p>Nearby, in Crossroads Gallery, there will be a floral display created by On Thai from Surroundings Floral Studio, with flowers supplied by Seagroatt Riccardi, LTD. The display will be centered around a 1934 green Ford Cabriolet, owned by Dave Mardon of West Sand Lake. </p>
<p>The University Jazz Band will perform outside the Savoy Tea Garden &amp; Caf&eacute; on Sunday. The caf&eacute; will serve tea, coffee, desserts and light luncheon fare, provided by Classe&prime; Catering. The 1930&rsquo;s inspired design and florals will be provided by Karen McGowan of Faddegon&rsquo;s Nursery. </p>
