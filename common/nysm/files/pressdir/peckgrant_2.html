<p>(ALBANY, NY) The New York State   Museum has received a  $3.1 million federal transportation grant to make mechanical upgrades to the  Day Peckinpaugh, paving the way for the historic canal boat&rsquo;s transformation  into a permanent floating museum, dedicated to sharing the history and heritage  of the state&rsquo;s canal system.</p>
<p> The grant  was among more than $81 million in federal funding for 59 transportation  projects across New York   State, announced by  Governor David Paterson. Funds will be allocated through the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for Transportation Enhancement Program (TEP)  projects. TEP finances transportation improvements with cultural, aesthetic,  historical and environmental significance. </p>
<p> &ldquo;These  projects will make necessary improvements to our local walkways, bicycle paths  and other transportation routes while spurring economic development and job  creation,&rdquo; Governor Paterson said. &ldquo;I  thank President Obama and the entire New York State Congressional Delegation  for working to ensure that transportation funds were included in the economic  recovery package. New York is committed to using the federal  resources at our disposal to put people back to work and ensure that our State  provides safe and accessible travel beyond that provided by traditional  highways and bridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;These  projects, which were made possible by the Economic Recovery Act, will both  beautify our neighborhoods, spur commerce and job creation and allow us to  better interact with our neighbors and surroundings,&rdquo; said U.S. Senator Charles  E. Schumer.</p>
<p>&quot;This tremendous historical  resource may now be shared across New    York State,  bringing to life the history of our famous canal corridor,&rdquo; said Commissioner  Richard P. Mills. &ldquo;New Yorkers can find inspiration in the remarkable  accomplishments of our past. The Regents and I are proud of our New York State Museum  staff and our many partners who have rescued the Peckinpaugh and will be giving  it this new role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Peckinpaugh is scheduled to have  temporary exhibits installed for the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain quadricentennial  celebration tour in August and September. This was organized  by the Erie Canal National Heritage Corridor, in conjunction with the State Museum,  Saratoga National Historical   Park and the New York  State Canal Corporation. This new federal grant will provide  funds for the rehabilitation work necessary before permanent exhibits can be  installed and the Peckinpaugh is ready for continuous tours. </p>
<p> Now listed  on the National Register of Historic Places, the Peckinpaugh was saved from the  scrap heap in 2005 through the efforts of the New York  State Museum,  in partnership with the New York   State (NYS) Canal Corporation;  NYS Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation; the Erie Canal National Heritage Corridor Commission; the National Park  Service and the Canal Society of New    York State. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This collaboration of state and  federal agencies, and private not-for-profits and private donors, have made  possible the rescue and rebirth of this iconic vessel,&rdquo; said New York State  Museum Director Dr. Clifford Siegfried. &ldquo;Not only will this rehabilitation  project result in the creation of jobs for steel workers, welders, electricians and others, but this traveling  museum will boost the economy of communities up and down the Hudson River  through increased tourism. It also will allow the State Museum  to reach out to new audiences and share the history of the canal system with  generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The value of  a waterborne traveling exhibition, dedicated to sharing the history of the  canal system, became apparent when more than a million visitors  turned out to visit the 1976 Bicentennial Barge, which reached several dozen communities over a  five-month journey. It is estimated that as much as 85 percent of the state&rsquo;s population live in regions  within a half-hour drive of the state&rsquo;s waterway network.</p>
<p> The  Peckinpaugh will follow a schedule of visits from New York   City to Plattsburgh to Buffalo to Ithaca.  When it is not touring during the navigation season it will be available for  tours at the historic Matton Shipyard at Peebles  Island State   Park in Waterford.  During the winter season it may also be open at its winter berth on the  Waterford Flight.</p>
<p> Plans call for the Peckinpaugh&rsquo;s  permanent exhibitions to be installed and ready for visitors by summer 2010.  The National Park Service will coordinate the development and operation of the  exhibitions in the 130-foot long open cargo hold of the motorship, which at one  time carried 160 tons of dry cement. While maintaining the Peckinpaugh&rsquo;s industrial  character, initial plans call for the creation of a gallery that is nearly as  large as some gallery spaces in the State   Museum. The gallery will  be universally accessible and compliant with the American Disabilities Act.. </p>
<p> This grant  will help to mitigate a decade of neglect that left many of the boat&rsquo;s  mechanical systems in disrepair when it was largely abandoned in Erie, Pa.  between 1995 and 2005. It follows a  $290,000 grant in 2006 from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and  Historic Preservation&rsquo;s Environmental Protection Fund that has been used to stabilize  the Peckinpaugh. Additional work will include the replacement of fuel tanks, ballast piping and  valves, the possible addition of a new ballast tank and the rebuilding of fresh  water, sanitary and electrical systems. Plans also include some hull plate  replacement, repair and painting.</p>
<p> As the first  motorship of its kind specifically designed for the dimensions of the 20th-century  Erie Barge Canal,  and the last surviving vessel of its kind remaining afloat, the Peckinpaugh has  become an iconic fixture on the state&rsquo;s waterways. Built in 1921 in Duluth, Minnesota to  carry grain from the Midwest to New    York City, it was the harbinger for nearly a hundred  other canal motorships that were seen everywhere on the waterway until  1950. In 1994, the Peckinpaugh made its  final commercial voyage, with communities from Rome  to Oswego  turning out to wave goodbye.</p>
<p>&quot;The  Canal Corporation is pleased to learn about the recent commitment to enhance  the historic Day Peckinpaugh,&rdquo; said Carmella R. Mantello, director of the New  York State Canal Corporation. &ldquo;The Day Peckinpaugh will not only traverse the  waterways this summer as part of the quadricentennial celebration, but will  travel across the New York State Canal System for years to come portraying the  significant story of the waterways of yesterday and today. The Corporation is proud to partner with many  of our partners to help ensure this legacy continues.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This  is fantastic news,&rdquo; said Beth Sciumeca, Erie Canalway National Heritage  Corridor director. &ldquo;These critical funds for restoration and interpretive  exhibits and programs will help the New York  State Museum  and its partners realize our goal of sharing the Day Peckinpaugh and New York's nationally  significant canal history with millions of New Yorkers.&quot;</p>
<p>Robert  Kuhn, assistant regional director for State Parks, said, &quot;State Parks is  thrilled to know that the Day Peckinpaugh calls Peebles Island State Park and  the park's historic Matton Shipyard its home.  We look forward to working with the New York State   Museum, the State Canal  Corporation, the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor, and our many local  partners to make Mattons a great heritage tourism destination for visitors to  the Peckinpaugh.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having  the Day Peckinpaugh project move ahead is great news,&rdquo; said Peter Wiles, Jr.,  chair of Canal New York  and president of Mid-Lakes Navigation Co., Ltd. &ldquo;Giving new purpose to this  historic vessel preserves the commercial heritage of this vessel and the NYS  Canal System. More importantly, the Day  Peckinpaugh's ability to travel permits her not only to display that heritage  within her former cargo holds, but also to demonstrate today's commercial  activity, while transiting NY State's waterways.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The New York   State Museum  is a cultural program of the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of  Cultural Education. Started in 1836, the  museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research  and collection survey in the United    States.
