<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - The New York State Museum Institute has named four upstate business leaders to its Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees oversees the New York State Museum Institute, which was founded in 1985. The Institute, a private, non-profit arm of the Museum, was established to ensure that valuable resources from the private sector are encouraged and sustained to advance the programs of the New York State Museum. The Institute also oversees the Museum's membership program.</p>
<p>"I am confident that the Institute Board's priorities of identifying and cultivating new revenue sources, increasing awareness and statewide presence, and increasing participation in partnerships will be greatly enhanced with their support," said James B. Howe, the president of the Board of Trustees. </p>
<p>The new trustees on the 20-member board are: James E. Blau, the president of Hudson Valley Container Co.; Kathleen A. Coddington, the Director of Advertising at the Albany Times Union; Tom Young, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs for Telergy, Inc.; and Michael Zarcone, Vice-President and Secretary to the Board at MetLife. Trustees are invited to serve two three-year terms.</p>
<p>"A committed and involved Board has been essential to the Institute's ability to enhance the private funds available for Museum programs and exhibitions. Our new trustees will be critical to this mission," said Laurie Roberts, the executive director of the Institute.</p>
<p>Blau resides in Loudonville and is president of Hudson Valley Container Co. He is active in numerous non-profit organizations and various local and national business groups including the Albany Institute of History and Art and the Troy Family YMCA Board of Directors. He is a Trustee of the Albany Rural Cemetery, serves on the Board of Directors of Pruyn House and is past Director of the Capital District YMCA.</p>
<p>Coddington has been the Director of Advertising at the Albany Times Union since March 1999. Prior to rejoining the Times Union last year, Kathleen was Director of Advertising at the Hartford Courant, Connecticut's largest newspaper, where she was chairwoman of the Courant's Staff Development and Leadership Committee. She is a member of the Hartford Rotary and Connecticut's Permanent Commission on the Status of Women.</p>
<p>Before joining Telergy, Young was the Chairman of the New York Power Authority where he oversaw an organizational restructuring resulting in spending reductions totaling $70 million. During his two terms as Mayor of Syracuse, the city earned national recognition from two presidential administrations for outstanding achievements in urban revitalization and housing and neighborhood renewal. From 1975 to 1985, he was Executive Director of the New York State Fair.</p>
<p>Zarcone is the Vice-President and Secretary to the Board at MetLife. In his prior capacity as the principal lobbyist for MetLife, he was the company's representative on legislative and regulatory issues before the New York State Legislature and the New York State Insurance Department. He is a member of the New York State Bar Association, the Pennsylvania Bar and the Bar of the District of Columbia.</p>
