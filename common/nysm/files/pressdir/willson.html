<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; An Albany High School senior, and member of the New York State   Museum&rsquo;s after-school  program, has received a prestigious 2009 Gates Millenium Scholarship (GMS) from  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;"> Ocasio  A. Willson, 17, of Albany is one of 1,000 low-income minority students from  around the country selected to receive the scholarship, which can be used at  the college of his choice to cover tuition, room, board and other covered  college expenses, from freshman year through graduation. The United Negro  College Fund (UNCF) administers the GMS program.</p>
<p> &ldquo;UNCF is  proud of Ocasio Willson for having earned one of the country&rsquo;s most prestigious  and selective scholarships,&rdquo; said Larry Griffith, GMS vice president. &ldquo;Getting  a college degree will open up a whole array of opportunities that will last the  rest of his life. He is setting an  example for students in Albany  and around the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Established  in 1999 through a $1 billion grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,  the GMS program provides tuition for low-income minority students who are  highly motivated and seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees. The goal of  GMS is to promote academic excellence and to provide an opportunity for  outstanding minority students with significant financial need to reach their  highest potential.</p>
<p> &quot;Ocasio  is an example of personal excellence,&rdquo; said New York State Education  Commissioner Richard P. Mills. &ldquo;He is a standard bearer for all of us.  This is yet another example of the power of museums to educate and  inspire.&quot;</p>
<p>Stephanie  Miller, the director of the Museum&rsquo;s after-school program, and Megan Bailey,  the Museum&rsquo;s assistant youth director, assisted Wilson with his application for the GMS  scholarship. As a member of the Museum&rsquo;s Discovery Squad after-school  program for the past 3 &frac12; years, Willson has mentored younger students and  facilitated several educational programs. In his resume he credits the after-school  program with creating an &ldquo;inventive and friendly environment in the museum that  stimulates the children&rsquo;s minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Museum&rsquo;s award-winning  after-school programs were established in 1987. The Museum Club (ages 8-13) and  Discovery Squads (ages 14-18) provide tutoring and educational enrichment  opportunities for youths from Albany&rsquo;s  underserved neighborhoods. Students receive homework help and reading support  and participate in interactive projects involving Museum exhibitions. In the  Discovery Squad teens receive essential job training, academic and personal  support, explore higher education opportunities and serve the Museum in a  variety of work-based capacities.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;">Although Willson  has not yet decided which college he will attend he plans to study economics  and political science and hopes someday to become a U.S. senator. During an interview  with NPR&rsquo;s Linda Wertheimer, <u>http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103257428&amp;sc=emaf</u>,  which aired nationally on April 19, Wilson  spoke about how he and his classmates are using President Barack Obama&rsquo;s name  as slang, not as a joke, but as a way to inspire fellow students. </p>
<p>Inspired by his love of politics, Obama&rsquo;s  candidacy, and his own desire to make a difference, Willson reached out to the  community last year to raise $2500 so he could attend Harvard summer school in  2008. He studied the Harlem Renaissance, earned four college credits, an &ldquo;A&rdquo;  and a glowing letter of recommendation from the professor who taught the  course. He also learned valuable writing skills and the importance of time  management.</p>
<p>In an essay Willson submitted as part  of his college applications, he credits the Harvard experience with helping to  transform him from someone who was &ldquo;without a clear focus to a senior with  visions of making a difference through politics.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Determined to overcome the odds of  growing up in a lower-income neighborhood, Willson enrolled in Albany High&rsquo;s  International Baccalaureate diploma program, has earned a 3.6 GPA and is  involved in a variety of activities. Demonstrated leadership ability, through  participation in community service or other activities, is among the criteria  used in selecting the winners of the Gates scholarship. Wilson has received the YMCA&rsquo;s Black and  Latino Achievers Award, was president of the Key Club, and is a member of the  Natural Helpers, NY Gear Up and the Counsel for Unity, among other  organizations. </p>
<p> The State Museum  is a cultural program of the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of  Cultural Education. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is open daily from 9:30  a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.
