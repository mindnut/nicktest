<title>Scientists to Inventory as Many Living Things as Possible at Iona Island and Marsh BioBlitz</title>

<p>STONY POINT, NY - They only have 24 hours to record as many living things as possible on a secluded island in the Hudson River. What will they find on and around Iona Island in Rockland County? A BioBlitz will be held there from <strong>noon Friday, September 15 through noon Saturday, September 16.</strong></p>
<p>Researchers from the New York State Museum, the Palisades Interstate Park Commission and other institutions will blitz the island to document the creatures and plant life that exist in this unusual place only about 30 miles north of New York City.</p>
<p>Biodiversity is an important concept and is threatened every day by human activities around the world. It is the variety of organisms and the variety of their ecosystems. All of these organisms play a roll in the ecosystem and every one of them is important. An incredible mix can be found even close to urban areas.</p>
<p>"Many people have this misconception that biodiversity is only associated with tropical rainforests - this is simply not true," said Ron Gill, a Biodiversity specialist at the museum. "By having a BioBlitz, we hope that more people will realize that there is a rich diversity of life in many areas of New York State."</p>
<p>The Iona Island BioBlitz follows two successful events both organized by the Museum's Biodiversity Research Institute. The first, at Peebles Island State Park in Waterford, NY, in 1999 resulted in 637 different species. A BioBlitz at Papscanee Island Nature Preserve in East Greenbush, NY, in May 2000 resulted in a count totaling 416 different species.</p>
<p>Iona Island has an interesting history. Native Americans inhabited it until the 1600s when it was sold to a Dutch family. Until 1869, the land was leased to various farmers, including the cultivar of the Iona grape. The island then became a summer resort, which included a shooting range and a hotel until 1899 when the US Navy used the island as an arsenal. By the 1960s, nearly all of the buildings on Iona Island were destroyed. In 1965, it was acquired by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which owns and manages the island and marsh to this day.</p>
<p>Iona Island measures about 100 acres and is bordered on the west by two tidal marshes, on the north by Doodletown bight, an expanse of shallows and mudflats, and on the east and south by the Hudson River. The marshes cover nearly 200 acres and are considered highly diverse habitat of excellent quality by the New York State Coastal Program.</p>
<p>Iona Island and Marshes are part of the Hudson River National Estuarine Sanctuary and Research Reserve and a National Landmark. More recently, the site was designated a Bird Conservation Area by the state in 1997.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: The island is a restricted area and is closed to the public. To obtain press credentials, directions and other important information for the event, reporters should call 518-486-2003 or email dliquori@mail.nysed.gov as soon as possible.</strong></p>
