<p><em>The Art of African Women: Empowering Traditions</em>, a major exhibition that presents an unprecedented survey of African artistic traditions passed down from mothers to daughters for centuries, will open Friday, October 8th in the New York State Museum's West Gallery.</p>
<p>The exhibition, which will be at the Museum through February 27th, features more than 140 photographs by internationally acclaimed Namibian-born photojournalist Margaret Courtney-Clarke. The photographs are complemented by dozens of objects - pottery, textiles, beadwork and other decorative arts - some of which have been photographed with their creators.</p>
<p>Captured during her 20-year quest to document traditions in the South, West and North Africa, the images in the exhibition pay homage to the beauty African women have created in their lives despite social, political and economic upheavals.  Courtney-Clarke, who was born and raised in Namibia, introduced this body of work in her award-winning books - <em>Ndebele, African Canvas</em> and <em>Imazighen: The Vanishing Traditions of Berber Women</em>. Her books have been translated into French, German, Italian and Dutch and have generated worldwide interest in these vanishing arts. </p>
<p>She also co-authored a series of juvenile books with Maya Angelou in 1994. In 1999 she released <em>Maya Angelou: The Poetry of Living</em>, a tribute, comprised of revealing photographs and interviews of the poet laureate and friend. </p>
<p>The exhibition surveys traditional interior and exterior housing design, pottery, weaving and other decorative arts. It includes three components -- an introduction to African women and their art forms, a section exploring the various motifs that appear in their work and a children's component, <em>African Kids</em>, designed to expose young people to traditional art forms and introduce them to the children from the South, West and North. </p>
<p>In recent years, Courtney-Clarke has devoted her time to the Ndebele Foundation, fundraising, 
building a Cultural Centre for Women and Children in South Africa and teaching the art of African women to the next generation.	</p>
<p>A free teacher workshop is offered by the State Museum on Thursday, October 28 from 4 to 6 p.m. The workshop includes an exhibition tour, resource materials and a related art activity. Reservations are required and may be made through the Capital Region Center for Arts in Education at (518) 442-4240.  </p>
<p>Also in connection with this exhibition, ICM Artists, LTD will present <em>Sweet Honey in the Rock in Concert</em> Friday, October 29th at 8 p.m. Courtney-Clarke is expected to appear at a pre-concert reception, which begins at 6 p.m., to celebrate the opening of the exhibition.
