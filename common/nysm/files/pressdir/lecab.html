<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Bonnie Yochelson, the consulting curator for the New York State Museum&rsquo;s <em>Berenice Abbott</em> exhibition, will  present a talk and slide show on the exhibition at the Museum on Wednesday,  September 16 in the Museum&rsquo;s Huxley Theater.</p>
<p> The free program -- &ldquo;The Trials and Triumphs  of Public Art&rdquo; -- will begin  at 7 p.m. and be followed by a question and answer session. The exhibition -- <em>Berenice  Abbott&rsquo;s Changing New York: A Triumph of Public Art &ndash; </em>will be open from 6 to 7 p.m. in the Museum&rsquo;s  Crossroads Gallery. The Yochelson program is made possible, in part, by  a grant from the New York State Archives Partnership Trust, which also provided  support for the exhibition. </p>
<p>Open through October 4, the exhibition showcases work  that is considered to be one of the monumental achievements of 20th  century photography. It features 40 original photographs taken by Abbott when  she was employed from 1935 to 1939 by the Federal Art Project (FAP) of the  Works Progress Administration (WPA) to capture the rapidly changing urban scene  in New York City.  In addition to photographs in the State  Museum&rsquo;s collection from this  Depression-era project, which Abbott called &ldquo;Changing New York,&rdquo; the exhibition  also includes additional images from the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY).</p>
<p>Dr. Yochelson  is an art historian and curator specializing in photography. She worked at the National Gallery of  Art in Washington, D.C.,  the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art before  becoming curator of prints and photographs at the Museum of the City of New York in 1987. After five years on staff, she became a  consultant to the Museum, organizing a major traveling exhibition of Currier  &amp; Ives prints (1995-1999) and publishing &ldquo;<em>Berenice Abbott: Changing New York, The Complete  WPA Project&rdquo;</em> (The New Press and MCNY) in 1997. She also organized a <em>Changing  New York</em> exhibition (1998-2000) that traveled to three European venues. Yochelson is currently organizing <em>Alfred Stieglitz&rsquo;s New </em><em>York</em><em>,</em> an exhibition with a catalogue for the South Street   Seaport Museum,  which will open in June 2010.</p>
<p>The  Museum will sponsor two other upcoming free programs in conjunction with the Abbott  exhibition. &ldquo;Creative Art Day&rdquo; will provide an opportunity for families to participate  in artful activities based on the exhibition on Saturday, August 29 and  Saturday, October 3, from 1 to 3 p.m. On both days participants will meet at  the Crossroads Gallery.
