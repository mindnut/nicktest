<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; In conjunction with the <em>Rockwell Kent:  This is My Own</em> exhibition, the New    York State Museum will present the film &ldquo;<em>Rockwell Kent</em>,&rdquo; a biographical  documentary, on Sunday, May 17.</p>
<p> The  three-hour showing is free and will be held from 1 to 4:30 p.m. in the Museum&rsquo;s  Huxley Theater. Filmmaker Frederick Lewis spent over 10 years and thousands of  his own money to make the film about Kent, a painter, author, illustrator,  adventurer and social activist, who was one of America&rsquo;s most famous personalities during the 1930s  and 1940s.</p>
<p> Lewis  not only researched and cataloged hundreds of documents, photographs and  letters, but he also traced Kent&rsquo;s  footsteps across the world, following Kent  in his many travels, to show how Kent&rsquo;s experiences inspired his  work. Lewis traveled to Greenland, Denmark, Alaska,  Russia and Tierra del Fuego,  off the tip of the South American mainland, where he rented a sailboat and  hired a crew in order to charter the same routes that Kent had  taken. Never having sailed before, Kent was  unaware that the waters he had chosen are some of the most dangerous in the  world. However, he returned with what he  considers some of the most amazing footage in the film. </p>
<p>The film shows the human story of Kent in  intricate detail, featuring interviews with people who knew him and are now deceased. For those who feel they are already knowledgeable  about Kent,  the film provides much additional information that was previously unknown,  uncovered through in-depth research.

<p>The Museum&rsquo;s June 27 Creative Art Day  program also will focus on Rockwell Kent. The free program invites  families to participate in artful activities based on the Kent  exhibition.

<p><em>Rockwell Kent: This is My Own </em>is the latest exhibition in the Bank of America&rsquo;s Great Art  Series, and is open until July 5 in the Museum&rsquo;s West Gallery. The exhibition  is the 20th installment of the Bank of America Great Art Exhibition  and Education Program, which brings works from New   York State&rsquo;s leading  art museums and collections to the State   Museum. The exhibition features  works from the collection of the Plattsburgh State Art Museum, State University  of New York at Plattsburgh, the most complete and balanced collection of Kent&rsquo;s  work in the United States. The collection was established by a gift and bequest  from Kent&rsquo;s  wife, Sally Kent Gorton. This exhibition is curated by Cecilia M. Esposito, director  of the Plattsburgh   State Art    Museum.</p>
<p> A critically acclaimed artist who  provided the illustrations for such classics as &ldquo;<em>Moby Dick</em>&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<em>Canterbury  Tales</em>,&rdquo; Kent succeeded in multiple endeavors during his lifetime. He was a  painter, muralist, illustrator, printmaker, book designer, graphic artist,  architect, builder, writer and editor, lecturer, navigator, world traveler and  political and social activist. </p>

On display are paintings, drawings, prints,  books, bookplates, photographs, dinnerware, advertising art and </p>
