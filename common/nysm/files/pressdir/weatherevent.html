<p style="text-align:justify;">The New York State Museum will open a new exhibition, <em>Weather Event</em>, featuring the work of  artist Charles E. Burchfield and his colorful depictions of the weather south  of Lake Erie on November 2, 2013. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On display in the West Gallery through February 23, 2014, the  exhibition features over sixty works of art, including watercolors, sketches  and Burchfield's journals. The exhibition was first organized by  and presented at the Burchfield Penney Art Center at SUNY Buffalo State. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&quot;The Board of Regents and  the State Museum are committed to partnering with institutions across the state  to bring a wide range of cultural treasures to Albany,&quot; said State Museum  Director Mark Schaming. &quot;We are pleased to host this important exhibition from  the Burchfield Penney Art Center. This is a unique opportunity to see this  collection of Charles Burchfield's visionary work, as one of America's most  revered artists of the twentieth century.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&quot;Charles Burchfield (1893-1967) was an artist, writer, designer, and naturalist  whose character was defined by his observation of the here, the now and the  hereafter,&quot; said Anthony Bannon PhD, Executive Director of Burchfield Penney  Art Center. &quot;This exhibition, drawn from the 26,000 objects in the Burchfield  archive at the Burchfield Penney Art Center, observes the artist's  contemplative transcription of weather, the cycles of environment and  atmosphere - and what it all meant to him. &nbsp;We are delighted to have the  opportunity to share his vision with the thought leaders of our state.&quot; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Burchfield's representations of  weather, wind, skies and sounds are unique historical records of the environment  near Lake Erie, where he lived for most of his life. Burchfield Penney Curator  and Manager of Archives, Tullis Johnson, worked with climatologist and Buffalo  State College professor Stephen Vermette, Ph.D., to present the dramatic and  complex natural phenomenon chronicled in more than 50 years of Burchfield's  writings, drawings and paintings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Vermette also worked with students  from Buffalo State College to recreate historical weather forecasts for the  days that many of Burchfield's early watercolors where made. These forecasts  are accessible in the exhibit through the use of smart phone technology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Burchfield's early works were  imaginative, stylized landscapes and rural scenes that often incorporated a  personal language of symbols. After moving to Buffalo from Ohio, he became  engrossed in the city's buildings, harbor, rail yards and surrounding  countryside. From this period, his works show an appreciation for American life  and a complex assessment of urban life in comparison to the countryside and  small town of his youth. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Burchfield's artistic  achievement was honored by the inauguration of the Charles Burchfield Center at  Buffalo State College on December 9, 1966.&nbsp; He died on January 11,  1967.&nbsp; The museum, now called the Burchfield Penney Art Center, holds the  world's largest collection of his work. </p>
