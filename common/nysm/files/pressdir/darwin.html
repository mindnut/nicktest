In honor of Charles Darwin's birthday on Wednesday, Feb. 12, the New York State Museum will serve a birthday cake, decorated with a confectionary reproduction of a Darwin lithograph, and present a lecture on "Sex, Power and Resources: How the Human Evolutionary Past Haunts our Ecological Future." Dr. Bobbi Low of the University of Michigan will speak about pressures that were prevalent in our evolutionary past and explore how our responses to those pressures played out then and how they show up in modern society.

At the end of the lecture, Dr. Low will sign her book, "Why Sex Matters: A Darwinian Look at Human Behavior."</p>
