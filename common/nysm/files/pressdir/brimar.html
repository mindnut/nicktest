<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Biodiversity Research Institute (BRI) and the New York State Museum will present weekly lectures in April focusing on recent biodiversity research, conservation and education initiatives in New York State. <br />
All lectures are free and will be held on Wednesdays at noon in the Carole F. Huxley Museum Theater. The lecturers will focus on the results of research that was funded by the New York State Biodiversity Research Institute. Lecture topics and dates are: <br />
 &bull; April 4 &ndash; &ldquo;From Ferns to Fens: Highlights of Biodiversity-related Research in New York State.&rdquo; Distinguished Teaching Professor Dr. Donald Leopold, chair of the faculty of environmental and forest biology at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, will review projects that he and his graduate students have worked on, including research on the hart&rsquo;s-tongue fern, habitat restoration for Karner blue butterflies, and diversity patterns in medium and rich fens.<br />
 &bull; April 11 &ndash; &ldquo;Disturbing Forest and Field to Maximize Biodiversity: from Micro-disturbance for Ceruleans to Mega-disturbance for Golden-wings.&rdquo; Dr. John Confer, associate professor of biology at Ithaca College, will discuss current conservation concerns for managing biodiversity, including golden-winged warblers that rely on disturbance-dependent ecosystems.<br />
 &bull; April 18 &ndash; &ldquo;The Flat Rock: New York&rsquo;s Native Jack Pine Forest from an Entomological Perspective&rdquo; New York&rsquo;s sandstone barrens, known as &ldquo;flat rock,&rdquo; has an insect fauna that has had to adapt to severe drought, severe cold, and intense fire. State Entomologist Dr. Timothy McCabe has surveyed insects (particularly moths) on the flat rock and will discuss the secret life of several of these barrens specialists.<br />
 &bull; April 25 &ndash; &ldquo;Mississippian and Rare: The Plight of Fishes on the Periphery of their Range&rdquo; Since the Allegheny River watershed is the only part of New York State drained by the Mississippi River system, several resident fishes are at the periphery of their range. Rarity can be
dismissed as a result of their confined range, but other factors may also play a role. Dr. Robert Daniels, curator of ichthyology and assistant director of research and collections at the New York State Museum, discusses habitat degradation and other environmental conditions affecting these species.<br />
The New York State Legislature created the Biodiversity Research Institute in 1993 to help meet the challenges associated with preserving the state&rsquo;s biodiversity. The BRI serves as a comprehensive source of information, which is used to advise both public and private agencies on matters relating to the status of New York&rsquo;s biological resources. Housed within the New York State Museum, the BRI is funded through the Environmental Protection Fund. The BRI includes several collaborators, including the State Museum, the New York Natural Heritage Program, Audubon New York, the state Department of Environmental Conservation, New York, Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and The Nature Conservancy. Further information is available at: http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri/ or by calling (518) 474-6531.<br />
The New York State Museum is a cultural program of the New York State Education Department. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at www.nysm.nysed.gov.<br />
