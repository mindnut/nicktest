<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Joan Steiner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Look-Alikes&rsquo;&rsquo; will be the theme of the New York State </p>
<p>Museum&rsquo;s next Family Fun Weekend May 5 and 6. </p>
<p>  Family Fun Weekend, presented by Fidelis Care, takes place from 1- 4 p.m. both </p>
<p>days. Activities, which are free of charge, are held mostly in Bird Hall, on the Museum&rsquo;s </p>
<p>first floor.<br />
    <br />
  The program coincides with the opening on Saturday, May 5 of Steiner&rsquo;s new </p>
<p>exhibition at the State Museum &ndash; Look-Alikes: The Amazing World of Joan Steiner. A</p>
<p>Hudson artist, Steiner uses everyday objects to create three-dimensional dioramas in </p>
<p>which the objects themselves become hidden. Her books &ldquo;Look-Alikes&rsquo;&rsquo; invite readers to </p>
<p>locate the familiar items -- a pretzel, coin or zipper -- from within the scenes she creates </p>
<p>of a park, ice cream shop or zoo. Adults and children often find that the search becomes </p>
<p>habit forming.</p>
<p>  At 1 p.m. Saturday, Steiner will present a 30-minute slide show in South Hall and </p>
<p>will be available to greet visitors after that. At 2 p.m. Saturday Lou Pollack, a <br />

<p>Albany-area artists who will participate in Sunday&rsquo;s program include Dave Geurin, Heidi </p>
<p>Weinman, Lisa McLain, Stephen Mead and Marcus K. Anderson.</p>
<p>  Throughout the afternoon on Saturday and Sunday, visitors will be able to make their </p>
