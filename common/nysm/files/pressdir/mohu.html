<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY,  N.Y. &ndash; The New York State Museum will participate in the Capital District&rsquo;s  week-long MoHu arts festival, which includes the opening of a Black Dimensions  in Art exhibition, complemented by a performance of the Empire State Youth  Orchestra (ESYO) Jazz Ensemble and the Tutti Celli Jr. Quartet.</p>
<p> <em>The  Concert for the Artist &ldquo;I</em>&rdquo; will be held October 15 from 1-2 p.m. in  Adirondack Hall. <em>The Artists&rsquo; I</em> art  exhibition, open October 7-15, is on the Museum&rsquo;s fourth-floor Terrace Gallery,  and was created especially by Black Dimensions in Art to celebrate MoHu <a href="http://www.mohufest.com/">www.mohufest.com</a>. Both events are free.  MoHu will feature dance, music and visual arts from sundown October 8-16. The  largest arts festival in the Capital District&rsquo;s history, it celebrates the  quality, vitality and diversity of the arts throughout Albany, Schenectady,  Rensselaer and Saratoga counties &ndash; the area that surrounds the confluence of  the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers. </p>
<p> <em>The  Artists&rsquo; I </em>includes paintings, drawings, photographs, quilts, textiles and  mixed media. The exhibition represents the essence of all things creative that  an artist draws upon. Whether the artist  is inspired by beauty, a place in time or a particular story, the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the  movement of energy that flows from the artist to his or her work. </p>
<p> In a collaboration of visual and  performing arts, the concert is designed to open the eyes and ears of both the  musicians and audience to the richness and synergies found in different art  forms. <em>The Concert for the Artist &ldquo;I</em>&rdquo;  is based on the premise that music and art serve as vehicles that encourage the  &ldquo;I&rdquo; to reach beyond boundaries and inspire the individual.</p>
<p> The Empire State Youth Orchestra  first joined forces with Black Dimensions in Art in November 2010 when the  organizations presented &ldquo;Pictures of an Exhibition&rdquo; at the Troy Savings   Bank Music    Hall. The ESYO jazz ensemble consists of 17  outstanding high-school jazz musicians from across the Capital District. Tutti  Celli Jr. is a cello quintet of African-American youths, both elementary and  high school students. They are mentored by the larger TuttiCelli, a  multi-cultural cello choir of all ages that performs in the Capital District. </p>
<p> Black  Dimensions in Art Inc. is a not-for-profit organization of artists, craftsmen,  and art enthusiasts working together to stimulate interest in the creative  expressions of art by people of African descent. The mission of Black  Dimensions in Art is to educate the public about the contributions of past and  present artists of African descent through exhibitions, publications, and other  media. It provides exposure and sales opportunities for artists, and encourages  youth, especially African-American youth, in the practice and appreciation of  the arts. </p>
