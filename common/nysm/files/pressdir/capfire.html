<title>STATE MUSEUM EXHIBIT ON CAPITOL FIRE OPENS MARCH 19</title>
<div id="inputted_date">3/10/2011</div>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; The &ldquo;<em>1911  Capitol Fire</em>&rdquo; exhibition will open at the New York State Museum on March 19  as part of a series of special events and programs commemorating the 100th  anniversary of the devastating fire that struck the New York State Capitol.</p>
<p> Many Albany residents awoke in  the early morning hours on March 29, 1911 to see the Capitol on fire. The  entire western side of the presumed fireproof building was engulfed in flames  shooting 200 feet high. The fast-moving flames destroyed much of the State  Library, the fifth largest in the U.S., which was housed in the  Capitol. More than 8,000 Museum objects stored in the Capitol were also destroyed  or lost. The fire caused the unprecedented destruction of the state&rsquo;s  intellectual, cultural and historic property and also claimed the life of the lone  night watchman. </p>
<p>Special events will include a  commemoration ceremony at the Capitol on March 29 at 10 a.m., sponsored by the  New York State Commission on the Restoration of the Capitol. The State Museum  also will host a preview of a WMHT documentary &ndash; &ldquo;<em>The New York Capitol Fire</em>&rdquo; &ndash; in the Huxley Theater on Monday, March  28 at 12:15 p.m. It will air on WMHT on Thursday, March 31. </p>
<p>Open until June 18 in the lobby of  the Office of Cultural Education (OCE), the exhibition is a collaboration  between the State   Museum, State Library and  State Archives and chronicles how the fire affected each of the OCE institutions  and their collections. It is based largely on the book, &ldquo;<em>The New York State Capitol and the Great Fire of 1911</em>,&rdquo; written by  Paul Mercer and Vicki Weiss, senior librarians in the State Library&rsquo;s Manuscripts  and Special Collections unit. </p>
<p>The exhibition will include dramatic  photographs, eyewitness accounts and artifacts that survived the blaze. One of those  is a section of the iron chain link that stretched across the Hudson River  between West Point and Constitution   Island to prevent British  vessels from navigating up the river during the American Revolution. West Point was a strategic site because  of the s-curve in the Hudson  there that forced large ships to slow down and become an easy target. The  links were recovered from the State Library ruins after the fire. Another  section of the chain is preserved at the West Point Military   Academy. </p>
<p>Also on display are an 1892 fire  helmet, lantern and fire nozzle, courtesy of Warren W. Abriel, a deputy chief  in the Albany fire department and a  fourth-generation Albany  firefighter. The helmet was worn by Abriel&rsquo;s great-grandfather, Reuben H.  Abriel, who manned Steamer 2 for the Albany Fire Department when it was a volunteer  force. </p>
<p>There also will be several objects  showing fire damage that were part of the Museum&rsquo;s world-famous Lewis Henry  Morgan collection. New   York state commissioned Morgan to gather objects from the  Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) communities in the state and from the Six Nations  reserve in Canada  in 1849-50. All but 50 of some 500 objects were on exhibit.</p>
<p>On the day of the fire Arthur C.  Parker, who was Seneca and the state&rsquo;s first archaeologist, risked his life to  save Museum collections and wrote that he was only able to save about 1,500 of  the 10,000 objects. The only items in the Morgan collection that survived were  in his office. The Parker family assisted Morgan in assembling the collection.</p>
<p> More  information on the Morgan collection will be available at one of the programs  planned at the Museum to complement the exhibition. The talks are all on  Tuesdays at 12:15  p.m. They are:</p>
