<title>NYS MUSEUM PLANS APRIL LECTURES ON NEW GEOLOGICAL RESEARCH </title>
<div id="inputted_date">03/15/12</div>
<body>
<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY &ndash; Topics ranging from potential  landslide hazards in New York State to the global demand for the state&rsquo;s valuable  Rare Earth Elements will be discussed in an April lecture series at the New York State Museum  focusing on new geological research.</p>
<p> Four free lectures  will be held every Wednesday, beginning April 4 at 12:10 p.m. in the Huxley  Theater. Lecture topics and  dates are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>April       4 &ndash; &ldquo;Slip Sliding Away: Landslide Hazards in New York!&rdquo; On May 4, 2011 the largest       landslide in New York State history occurred near Keene Valley       in the high peaks region of the Adirondacks.       Approximately 82 acres of land and five homes were impacted, one of which was       destroyed. In the Capital District a year of heavy rains, combined with       large scale temporal events such as Hurricane Irene, created numerous       slope failures. Dr. Andrew Kozlowski, a glacial geologist at the State Museum,       will describe New York        State&rsquo;s sliding       slopes and the potential for the development of more geologic hazards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>April  11 &ndash; &ldquo;Ultimate Geo-Puzzler: The Rocks Atop the Appalachians <strong>--</strong> 400 Million Years Ago.&rdquo; New York State  Earth Science students all learn of the uplift of the Appalachian   Mountains, which have been eroding for millions of years. In fact,  sand, mud and gravel from their erosion make up much of New York&rsquo;s sedimentary rocks. Dr. Chuck Ver  Straeten, curator of stratigraphy and sedimentology, will discuss whether it is  possible to determine what kinds of rocks were visible up in the mountains  around 400 million years ago.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>April       18 &ndash; &ldquo;The Trenton-Black River       Natural Gas Reservoirs.&rdquo; In the past decade, over30 new       natural gas fields have been discovered in laterally discontinuous dolomites       of the Upper Ordovician Black River Group in south-central New York. These       fields occur as long, linear-shaped bodies that develop around       basement-rooted wrench faults. Brian Slater, a State Museum       geologist, will explain how and when these valuable state resources       formed.<strong> </strong></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>April       25 -- &ldquo;<a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2002/fs087-02/">Mineral Resources for High       Technology</a>: The Rare Earth Elements (REE)&rdquo; Many       &quot;green&quot; technologies, the automobile industry, and advanced       military technology depend on Rare Earth Elements (REE). Dr. Marian Lupulescu, curator of geology,       will talk about the Economic Geology of the REE mineral deposits, their       strategic significance, national priority, and global demand and supply.<strong> </strong></li>
