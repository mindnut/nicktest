<p>ALBANY, NY, USA) &ndash; The New York State Museum and Le Caen Memorial in Caen, France have organized a major exhibition exploring the personal and historical significance of September 11, 2001, which will open at Le Caen Memorial June 6.</p>
<p> The exhibition, &ldquo;A Global Moment,&rdquo; open through November 11, features rare artifacts from the World Trade Center (WTC) recovered after the collapse, and a timeline that traces events of the day. It also will include personal stories and objects, images, interactive programs and films about everyday life at the World Trade Center, and the aftermath of the attack. The exhibition&rsquo;s goal is to help visitors gain a clearer understanding of the events of September 11, learn more about the people whose lives were lost, and provide visitors with a platform to share their experiences relating to the tragedy. There also will be a section to inform visitors about the rebuilding and memorial at the WTC site.</p>
<p> About 8,000 square feet in size, the exhibition will include hundreds of photographs, and more than 100 artifacts from the WTC towers, culled from the State Museum&rsquo;s collections. The exhibition will include a rescue vehicle destroyed on 9/11, personal objects linked to several individuals who perished or survived, and expressions of sympathy from New York, such as the Times Square scrolls, memorial fences and posters of missing persons. </p>
<p> The exhibition is divided into themed sections. The introduction focuses on the World Trade Center before September 11. Visitors will see WTC artifacts, photographs of the WTC, and video/ films from the Power Authority of New York and New Jersey showing everyday life at the WTC. Facts about the site, and WTC construction will also be included.  </p>
<p>In another section of the exhibition, visitors will experience a large walk-through timeline, with images, text, artifacts and sound, designed to help visitors understand how the day unfolded, the sequence</p>
<p>of the attacks, evacuations and collapse of the towers. Objects will include a WTC sign, steel and </p>
<p>aluminum facade of the tower, airplane pieces, a seatbelt from one of the airliners, and rescue objects from the New York City fire and police departments. Also included are objects recovered from the WTC site, including the remains of an Alexander Calder sculpture, a destroyed fire department vehicle, elevator signs, keys and evacuation signs. This area will also feature &ldquo;The First 24 Hours,&rdquo; a film by French filmmaker Etienne Sauret.</p>
<p>Another section will feature images and artifacts of Ground Zero and the recovery operation at Fresh Kills, a former landfill on Staten Island whose name, &ldquo;fresh stream,&rdquo; came from early Dutch settlers. This area will show the extent of this historic and humanitarian operation that was designed to find remains of every person lost, and their personal possessions. Objects on display will include a Rodin sculpture fragment, WTC souvenirs, signs, rescue artifacts and destroyed lamppost fragments. A computer kiosk will allow visitors to access interviews with the recovery teams, FBI, New York City police and others. &ldquo;Collateral Damages,&rdquo; another film by Sauret, will also be shown. </p>
<p> The international response to the tragedy will be the focus of another area of the exhibition. Many people recall exactly where they were and how they learned of the attacks on September 11. A customized interactive unit will record visitors&rsquo; comments. After the exhibition tour, the recorded responses will be archived at the New York State Museum and at the Caen Memorial Museum. </p>
<p> Biographies of several 9/11 victims and survivors will help to put a human face on the tragedy. &ldquo;Portraits of Grief,&rdquo; from the New York Times, will be available in this area.</p>
