<title>NEW STATE MUSEUM EXHIBIT SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON EXTINCT NYS PARAKEET</title>

<p>(ALBANY,   NEW YORK) &ndash; A new exhibition in the  lobby of the New York   State Museumprovides  visitors with a rare opportunity to see and learn about an iconic North  American parakeet, which has been extinct for more than a century. </p>
<p> The exhibition features the Carolina  Parakeet, which was once New York&rsquo;s  only native parrot species. It is based  on newly published research conducted by Dr. Jeremy Kirchman, the Museum&rsquo;s  curator of birds. Kirchman&rsquo;s study is  highlighted in a cover article in the April issue of <em>The</em> <em>Auk,</em> an international  journal of ornithology. The artwork in the exhibition is a digitally updated  painting of Carolina Parakeets that was originally created by Michael Rothman  and displayed in the State   Museum&rsquo;s first <em>Focus on Nature</em> exhibition in 1990.. </p>
<p> &ldquo;This new lobby exhibition is part  of our <em>New York Discovery</em> series  through which we periodically share exciting new research conducted by State Museum  biologists, anthropologists, geologists and historians,&rdquo; said Museum Director  Mark Schaming. &ldquo;We hope this information about the natural and cultural history  of New York  will enhance the educational experience of all visitors, young and old alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Carolina Parakeet became extinct  before any systemic study of its ecology or evolution was undertaken. Kirchman  extracted small amounts of degraded DNA from four Carolina Parakeet specimens  in the State Museum&rsquo;s  collections and teamed up with scientists at New Mexico State   University to use the  genetic data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the species. DNA from  the Museum&rsquo;s specimens was compared to the genetic data from 43 species of  parrots from South and Central America and the Caribbean, and from more  distantly related species from Africa and Asia. </p>
<p> The study found that the Carolina  Parakeet was genetically distinct from all other sampled parrot species and may  have colonized North America from South America  as long as 5 million years ago, well before the continents were joined  approximately 3.5 million years ago. </p>
<p> The Carolina Parakeet once lived and  bred<strong> </strong>throughout the eastern half of  North America as far north as Albany and the  shores of Lake Ontario, making it by far the most  northerly distributed species of parrot. Carolina Parakeets were shot for  sport, feathers and to protect agricultural crops. Loss of breeding habitat  also may have contributed to its demise.  By the time laws were passed to protect birds in the United States,  some species, including Labrador Duck, Great Auk, and Passenger Pigeon were  already extinct, and Carolina Parakeets had been pushed to the brink. The last  reliable sightings of Carolina Parakeets were in Florida in the 1920s. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Our new study using DNA sequencing  technology to analyze specimens up to 130 years old highlights the enduring  value of the State   Museum&rsquo;s collections,&rdquo;  said Kirchman. &ldquo;Our continued research and exhibition of Carolina Parakeets  reminds us that there once was a time when wild bird populations were not  protected from indiscriminant destruction. The millions of birders and nature  lovers of New York  have been deprived of an important element of our shared natural history.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Kirchman and Rothman will present a  free lecture on the science and art behind <em>The  Auk</em> article.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Insights on Evolution and Extinction of New York's only  native parrot, the Carolina Parakeet&rdquo; will be presented on Saturday, May 5 from  1-2 p.m. in the Museum&rsquo;s Huxley Theater.</p>
<p>Established in 1836, the New York State Museum  is a program of the State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education.  Located on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on  Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
