<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - The New York State Museum will extend its hours to host another After Hours evening of music, exhibit tours and refreshments on Friday, Jan. 21 from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The acoustic guitar music of national recording artist Marcus Ruggerio will be featured on the Museum's fourth-floor Terrace Gallery that overlooks the Empire State Plaza.</p>
<p>"Our premier After Hours in August was wildly popular, quickly selling out, so we decided to make the After Hours program a regular part of our offerings," Museum Director Cliff Siegfried said.</p>
<p>"Visitors will not only be treated to an evening of great music, food and beverages, but our experts will be on hand to give tours of some very exciting exhibits."</p>
<p>Curators will provide numerous tours throughout the evening of Trains that Pass in the Night: The Railroad Photographs of O. Winston Link, Looking Back: The State Museum in the Year 2000 and Minerals of New York.</p>
<p>Admission to this event is $12 per person in advance. Members pay $10 per person. Anyone wishing to attend may call 518/474-5801 to purchase tickets. The admission price includes food, music and tours. Drinks will be available. The event is sponsored by The River, WRVE and the Big House Brewing Company.</p>
