<p>New York State Museum Specialist Gay Malin will display and talk about the facial reconstructions she has completed, based on the remains of two individuals found during the 2002 excavations at the site of the former Albany County Almshouse (1826-1926).  She also will show a video demonstrating the facial reconstruction process. An excavation at the Almshouse cemetery during the spring of 2002 unearthed about 1200 skeletons that were studied by Museum scientists and reburied at Albany Rural Cemetery. The archaeological survey of the site was undertaken prior to the construction of a biomedical research laboratory built at the site by the Charitable Research Foundation.  The former almshouse was located behind the World War I-era Armory diagonally across from Albany Medical Center. Malin will be available to answer questions.</p>
