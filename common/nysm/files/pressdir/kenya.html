<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A Lake Placid native, who discovered her life&rsquo;s passion teaching in Kenya, will talk about her experiences during a presentation at the New York State Museum on Saturday, March 15.</p>
<p>As part of the 1 p.m. program in the Huxley Theater, Keela Dates will also show photographs focusing on her work as a teacher at the Jambo Jipya School. Dates traveled to Kenya to volunteer there shortly after getting her elementary education certificate in 2006. She expected to stay for a short time and then return home to secure a teaching job in New York State. Instead, she found her life&rsquo;s calling there and plans to return. </p>
<p> Further information on Dates and her experience can be found at <a href="http://www.reason2smile.org/">www.reason2smile.org</a>. </p>
