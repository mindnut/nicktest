<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; On Sunday, July 12 the New York State Museum will present &ldquo;<em>Theater of Resistance</em>,&rdquo; an original  production featuring vignettes from five plays connected to accomplished  African-Americans. </p>
<p> The free program will be presented  in the Museum&rsquo;s Clark Auditorium. Local actors will perform at 3 p.m. in  vignettes from Eugene O'Neill's &quot;<em>The Emperor Jones,</em>&quot; Howard  Sackler's &quot;<em>The Great White Hope</em>,  Ntozake Shange's &quot;<em>For Colored Girls</em> . .,&quot; Lorraine Hansberry's &quot;<em>A  Raisin in the Sun</em>&quot; and Ossie Davis' rendition of a book by Langston  Hughes, &quot;<em>Purlie Victorious</em>.&quot; </p>
<p> The production is a tribute to  abolitionist Henry  Highland Garnet and was inspired by a sermon Garnet delivered in 1843 while  serving as a minister at Liberty Presbyterian Church in Troy. &ldquo;Let your Motto be resistance,&rdquo; Garnet  told the congregation. &ldquo;Resistance! Resistance! No opposed people have ever  secured liberty without resistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;<em>Theater of Resistance</em>&rdquo; is produced and directed by Donald &ldquo;The Soul  Man&rdquo; Hyman of Albany, a  singer, writer, actor, elder, and teacher. He can be seen in the History  Channel movie,</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The Revolution</em>&quot; and the upcoming  PBS special, &quot;<em>The American General</em>.&quot;  Hyman has </p>
<p>performed  off-Broadway at Albany Civic Theater, The Palace Theater in Albany  and Proctor&rsquo;s in Schenectady.  His current one-man show &quot;SAFE,&quot;  which he wrote about Buck Leonard, the Negro Leagues&rsquo; Homestead Grays player,  has been performed around the Capital Region. He recently performed as Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. in &quot;Voices of Civil Rights,&quot; a program for the  Legends and Legacies Lecture Series, a monthly series he founded at Albany Public  Library.
