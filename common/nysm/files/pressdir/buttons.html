<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; The New York State Museum will host a special temporary exhibition of rare artifacts, reflecting more than two centuries of New York State politics and social history, on Friday, September 28.</p>
<p> The exhibition, from 1-5 p.m in the West Gallery, will feature artifacts from the most comprehensive, one-of-a-kind collection, in public hands, providing documentation of New York State&rsquo;s gubernatorial elections. Museum curator Craig Williams will be available to answer questions about the collection.</p>
<p>The artifacts reflect historically important issues that were discussed and debated by major and third party candidates in New York State and the country-at-large, including transportation, civil rights, education, abolition, the environment, suffrage and prohibition. The display also shows how campaign literature has evolved from being very formal to more casual and creative. </p>
<p> Included are posters, banners and broadsides from the New York State Library and photos, ballots, campaign buttons, convention badges and other artifacts from the Museum collection. Most of the artifacts are displayed in more than 100 framed trays, as they were when received from the donor, Bill Winnewisser of Syracuse. </p>
<p>The exhibition spans the eras from the 1787 campaign of Governor George Clinton to the 2006 campaign of Governor Eliot Spitzer. Some items from the collection were included in an exhibition held at the Museum on New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>The New York State chapter of the American Political Item Collectors (APIC), in the area for a weekend convention, will visit the exhibition on Friday. Started in 1945, APIC has more than 2,000 members and is one of the oldest hobby organizations in the country, along with coin and stamp collector organizations. Members come from all walks of life, with interests in history, politics, social movements and the environment.</p>
<p>The APIC convention is open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 8 a.m. to 3p.m at the Best Western Sovereign Hotel, 1228 Western Ave. Members and the general public may buy, sell and trade political campaign memorabilia and visit with other collectors. Free appraisal services are available. </p>
<p> The New York State Museum, established in 1836, is a program of the New York State Education Department. Located at the Empire State Plaza on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum&rsquo;s non-holiday hours are daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free and the Museum is fully accessible.
