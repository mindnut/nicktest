<title>AWARD-WINNING DOCUMENTARY COMING TO NYS MUSEUM JULY 1 </title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; On July 1, the New York   State Museum  will present the Emmy award-winning HBO documentary &ldquo;Baghdad ER,&rdquo; followed by a  reunion and discussion between the producer and the first wounded soldier to  appear in the film. </p>
<p>Following the  6:30 p.m. film presentation, producer/director Matthew O&rsquo;Neill will be reunited  with Staff Sgt. Craig Macy from Buffalo, a New  York National Guard Soldier who was wounded in Iraq in 2005. Macy will speak about  his experiences as a wounded veteran, appearing in the documentary and his  continuing membership in the National Guard.</p>
<p>The program is  being held in conjunction with the new Museum exhibition &ldquo;<em>Citizen Soldier: New York&rsquo;s National Guard  in the American Century,</em>&rdquo; open in Exhibition Hall through March 2011. </p>
<p>When it was  released in 2006, &ldquo;Baghdad ER&rdquo; was the most honored documentary of the year,  winning four Emmy Awards for its &ldquo;unflinching&rdquo; look at the cost of war. It also  won a Peabody Award, the Overseas Press Club Award and the Alfred I. duPont  Columbia Award. The groundbreaking documentary chronicles the day-to-day lives  of doctors, nurses, medics, soldiers and chaplains in the Army's premier  medical facility in the combat zone. O&rsquo;Neill  and producer Jon Alpert were given unprecedented access to the Army&rsquo;s 86th Combat Support   Hospital during a  two-month period in 2005. </p>
<p>The film  captures the skill, dedication and heroism of military medical professionals as  they work to save lives from their trauma center in the middle of war-ravaged Iraq. It also  shows the sacrifices endured by America&rsquo;s  wounded warriors. The film is not suitable for children. It includes graphic  scenes that are at times disturbing and when the film first came out, the Army  was concerned about the emotional impact it might have on troops and military  families. Instead, the film became  almost required viewing for all members of the military medical community and went on to receive critical  acclaim from both inside and outside the U.S. military. </p>
<p>Macy was serving  with the National Guard&rsquo;s 1st Battalion 69th Infantry in Iraq in 2005  when he was struck by a sniper as he was handing out candy to Iraqi children. Thanks to his comrades who rushed to his aid,  and the expert medical care he received at the trauma center, Macy survived his  ordeal, recovered and returned to duty with the National Guard. He volunteered for a deployment to Afghanistan in  2008 with nearly 1700 New York National Guard troops. While still a member of the National Guard,  Macy is now a police officer with the City of Buffalo. He recently became a new father and  has named his son after one of the soldiers who pulled him to safety in  2005. </p>
<p>This program is the first in a  series of special programs that the State   Museum is hosting in  conjunction with the &ldquo;Citizen Soldier&rdquo; exhibition. The exhibition recounts the  history of the New York National Guard and those who carried out its mission  through wars and battles, natural disasters and national emergencies. The  National Guard is based on a tradition dating back to colonial times in a state  that has always been guided by the principle that its defense lies in the hands  of its citizenry.  Citizen soldiers are everyday people who put their lives on hold to  defend, aid and protect their communities and their country. </p>

Located at the Empire State Plaza  on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day.
