<p style="text-align:justify;">A large American flag  recovered from the site of the World Trade Center following the September 11,  2001 terrorist attacks in New York City is on display for the first time in the  lobby of the New York State Museum to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the  attacks. The flag was draped over the crushed remains of the New York City Fire  Department (FDNY) Engine Company 6 pumper as it was removed from Ground Zero. The  Engine 6 pumper is now installed in the State Museum&rsquo;s World Trade Center  exhibit. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Six firefighters from Engine 6 were dispatched to  the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001 and four men from  the Company&mdash;Lieutenant  Thomas O&rsquo;Hagan, Firefighter Paul Beyer, Firefighter William Johnson, and  Firefighter Thomas Holohan&mdash;were killed in the collapse. Firefighters  Billy Green and Jack Butler survived. The Engine 6 flag will hang in the  State Museum lobby through the end of October.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;This  historic American flag resonates with the history of September 11, 2001,&rdquo; said  State Museum Director Mark Schaming. &ldquo;For the first time this iconic flag is on  display in the Museum along with the FDNY Engine 6 pumper, an artifact central  to the State Museum's 9/11 collection. These objects from the World Trade  Center site speak to the loss, heroism and global impact that the exhibition  evokes for visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, there are new  artifacts on display in the&nbsp;<em>Response</em>&nbsp;section of the World  Trade Center exhibition, revisiting the many individuals and groups in New York  City and around the country who helped to preserve a legacy of those tragic  days. Five collections of objects from the World Trade Center Sites are on  display. Items include a handprint flag made at Fort Myers (Florida) High  School that hung in the respite center at the World Trade Center Recovery  Operation on Staten Island; objects sent to The World Trade Center Relief fund  including a teddy bear and two albums filled with children&rsquo;s drawings that were  sent in with their contribution, usually their weekly allowance or a few coins;  personal items of a fallen Port Authority attorney and his family including a  family pass, safety helmet, booklet, and badge that were used to gain access to  the site; and a canvas banner where visitors to Saint Paul&rsquo;s Chapel were  encouraged to write comments and reflection. Also on view is a roof truss  fragment from one of the World Trade Center buildings; a piece of the building  that was constructed to hold the building together. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With hundreds of thousands of  artifacts, the State Museum is the world&rsquo;s largest repository of objects  recovered from the World Trade Center site after September 11, 2001. The  artifacts are rotated through the Museum&rsquo;s permanent World Trade Center  exhibition, which opened in September 2002. The Museum also supports other  institutions nationwide and beyond with their World Trade Center-related  exhibitions. More information about the exhibit is available here:<br />
