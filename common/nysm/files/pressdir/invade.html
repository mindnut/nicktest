<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Biodiversity Research Institute (BRI) and the New York State Museum will present weekly lectures in May focusing on the effect of non-native organisms on the environment and economy of New York State. </p>
<p> The free lectures are being held in conjunction with the Invaders exhibition, which will be at the Museum through March 15, 2009. All lectures are free and will be held on Wednesdays at 7 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. Lecture topics and dates are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>May 7 &ndash; &ldquo;Confronting Biological Invasions: A Growing Environmental Problem.&rdquo; Species that are deliberately or accidentally introduced to new environments cause billions of dollars in economic damage and endanger native species worldwide. In New York, introduced invasive species have transformed most of the state&rsquo;s ecosystems, and more problematic species are on the way. Dr. David Strayer, of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, will review the history and impact of a few prominent invaders, the extent and causes of these introductions, and proposed solutions to this growing problem.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>May 14 &ndash; &ldquo;Biological Invasions: How Mild Species Go Wild.&rdquo; Invasive species owe their aggressiveness and influence to inherent traits combined with other factors. Scientists are developing ways to predict the potential for a newly introduced organism to become a problem species. Dr. George Robinson, of the Department of Biological Sciences, State University of New York at Albany, will use case studies that illustrate potential &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for reducing risky introductions, although the ability to predict invasiveness is still limited due to evolutionary &ldquo;wild cards.&rdquo;</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>May 21 &ndash; &ldquo;Worm Invasions: Predatory Planarians, Earthworms, and Novel Ecologies&rdquo; Dr. Peter K. Ducey, of the Department of Biological Sciences, State University of New York at Cortland, will discuss flatworms from Asia, as well as earthworms, presumably from Europe and Asia, that are now widely distributed in the United States. These earthworms and predatory flatworms could negatively affect a variety of environments by altering physical and biological components. The extent of the effects may depend on ecological interactions among invaders, and interactions between invasive and native species.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>May 28 &ndash; &ldquo;Detecting Invasive Species: The NYS Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey Program&rdquo; The early detection of introduced species, which could damage agricultural crops, is the primary mission of the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) of the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Kenneth L. Carnes, State Survey coordinator, will address survey technologies, present trapping protocols, and provide handouts of the 2008 NY-CAPS targets. He will provide information about early detection of invasive species and how the public can become involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The New York State Legislature created the Biodiversity Research Institute in 1993 to help meet the challenges associated with preserving the state&rsquo;s biodiversity. The BRI serves as a comprehensive source of information, which is used to advise both public and private agencies on matters relating to the status of New York&rsquo;s biological resources. Housed within the New York State Museum, the BRI is funded through the Environmental Protection Fund. The BRI includes several collaborators, including the State Museum, New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, State University of New York, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Audubon New York, the New York Natural Heritage Program, and The Nature Conservancy. Further information is available at: <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri">www.nysm.nysed.gov/bri</a> or by calling (518) 474-6531.</p>
<p>The New York State Museum is a cultural program of the New York State Education Department. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
