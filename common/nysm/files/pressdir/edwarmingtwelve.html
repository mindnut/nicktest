<title>NYS PALEONTOLOGIST REPORTS NEW CLIMATE CHANGE STUDY</title>

<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; As we continue to experience one of the warmest winters on record in the  Northeast, the New York   State paleontologist is  reporting new research suggesting that high sea levels leading to &ldquo;global  hyperwarming&rdquo; are much more important than carbon dioxide levels in predicting global  climate change. </p>
<p>Dr. Ed Landing, state paleontologist  and curator of paleontology at the New    York State Museum, has recently published his  findings online in &ldquo;<em>Palaeogeography,  Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology,&rdquo; </em>an international  journal that publishes<strong> </strong>high quality  and multi-disciplinary, original studies with global implications in the field  of palaeo-environmental geology. </p>
<p>Since the middle 1800s scientists  have considered high carbon dioxide levels to be a greenhouse gas and a driver of higher global temperatures.  However, Landing&rsquo;s study of the rock succession in New York state shows that periodic extreme  temperatures, with oceans reaching 100 F, occurred within &ldquo;greenhouse&rdquo;  intervals. He terms these &ldquo;global hyperwarming&rdquo; times, and shows that they  correspond to intervals of very high sea-levels. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Global hyperwarming&rdquo; is a previously  unrecognized climate condition. As sea levels rise, Landing&rsquo;s research suggests  that with the predicted melting ofpolar ice caps, the continents will  reflect less sun light back to space and less reflective shallow seas will  store heat and warm as they overlap the land.Warming seas  willrapidly work to increase global temperatures and heat the world  ocean. This leads to a feedback that further expands ocean volume, with  heating,and furtheraccelerates both global warming and sea-level  rise. In the course of this feedback, marine water circulation and oxygenation  fall due in part to the fact thathot waters hold less oxygen. </p>
<p>Landing firstrecognized the  imprint of &quot;global hyperwarming&quot;in 520 to 440 million-year-old,  shallow to deep-water rocks in eastern New    York and from other information received on localities worldwide. This time interval shows nine intervals of extreme  sea-levels that coveredmuch of NorthAmerica  and other ancient continents. In all  cases, strong sea-level rises, which sometimes drove marine shorelines into the  upper Midwest,are accompanied by the spread of hot, low oxygen marine  water largely devoid of animal life down into the deep sea and across the  continents.</p>
<p>Landing&rsquo;s study may help predict the  future. A 300-foot sea-level rise, which would result from melting the Greenland  and Antarctica ice caps, is as great as the  ancient sea-level rises documented by Landing and other scientists 520 to 460  million years ago. This sea-level rise would also lead to a warming and  expansion of the ocean waters resulting in a rise of shorelines to 500 feet  above present, basically covering the non-mountainous U.S. to northern Wisconsin. Even worse, in the case of New York, the Earth&rsquo;s  rotation would force a rise of the west Atlantic to 650 feet above present sea  levels. </p>

While working at the State Museum  since 1981, Landing has authored six books, 13 New York State   Museum bulletins, 200  articles and field trip guides and has received more than a dozen competitive  grants. In 2009 he was elected a fellow of the American Association for the  Advancement of Sciences (AAAS), a high honor bestowed upon a select group of  geologists nationwide </p>
<p>Founded in  1836, the State Museum is a program of the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s  Office of Cultural Education. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is  closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
