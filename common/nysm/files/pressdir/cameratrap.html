<title>STATE MUSEUM SCIENTIST'S PHOTOS ON NEW WEBSITE</title>
<div id="inputted_date">3/08/11</div>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A New York State Museum scientist  has collaborated with Smithsonian colleagues to make more than 202,000 wildlife  photos available to the public for the first time through a new searchable  website called Smithsonian Wild.</p>
<p>The new website, at <a href="http://siwild.si.edu/">siwild.si.edu</a>, allows the public to see  exactly what scientists see in their research &mdash; photos of wildlife captured at  close range, from the head-on stare of a jaguar in Peru  to inside the mouth of a giant panda in China. Three of the nine photo sets  available on the site come from research in the Adirondacks and other locations,  conducted by Dr. Roland Kays, the State   Museum&rsquo;s curator of  mammals. The site operates off of a database that was created as part of Kays&rsquo; National  Science Foundation funded research. </p>
<p> The images  were taken through camera traps &ndash; automated cameras triggered by motion  sensors. Left in natural areas to photograph whatever passes in front of them,  the cameras record the diversity and often the behavior of animals around the  world. Studying animals in the wild can be challenging, especially if it  involves a rare or elusive species like the giant panda or the clouded leopard,  where camera traps have provided critical data as well as amazing photos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most exciting parts of  biology field work is to check a camera trap and have the first look at the  animal pictures,&rdquo; said Kays. &ldquo;We wanted  to share this thrill of discovery with the public, let them see all the  pictures, the good ones and the bad ones, to get a new perspective on nature.&rdquo; </p>
<p>All of the photos are untouched and  appear exactly as they did when they were taken from the cameras. The current  website includes both still photos and video clips of more than 200 species of  mammals and birds from seven projects conducted by Smithsonian researchers and  their colleagues. The site provides links through social media such as Flickr,  Twitter and Facebook to allow the public to share and comment on the photos.  The site also provides reference links from each photo to corresponding species pages at the Encyclopedia of Life, the International  Union for the Conservation of Nature, and the Smithsonian&rsquo;s National Museum of  Natural History&rsquo;s own &ldquo;North American Mammals&rdquo; page, which Kays also  collaborated on.</p>
<p> Further  information also is available in a &ldquo;Museum Moment&rdquo; YouTube video featuring Kays  on the State Museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>. </p>
<p>The new photo website is part of the  Smithsonian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; initiative to make research conducted by Smithsonian  scientists and their colleagues more accessible to the public. The primary goal  of this initial effort is to share the unique information collected around the  world by these cameras with the broader public, giving them a better sense not  only of the diversity of wildlife that exists, but also of the diversity of  wildlife research at the Smithsonian.</p>
<p> The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Started  in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural  history research and collection survey in the United States. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, it is open daily  from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.  Admission is free. Further information about programs and events can be  obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
