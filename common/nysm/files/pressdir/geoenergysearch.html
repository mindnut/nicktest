<title>NYSGS TO PLAY KEY ROLE IN NATIONAL GEOTHERMAL ENERGY SEARCH</title>

<p>ALBANY &ndash; As part of a nationwide  project to identify and assess new sources of renewable geothermal energy that  could help mitigate global warming, the New York State Geological Survey (NYSGS)  has received a $280,000 federal grant to collect data that will help scientists  to better understand the potential for geothermal resources in New York State.</p>
<p>Energy Secretary Stephen  Chu has announced awards totaling $338 million for geothermal energy research  across the country that includes the creation of a comprehensive nationwide  geothermal resource data system by the nation&rsquo;s State  Geological Surveys to help identify and assess new fields. </p>
<p>The New York State  Geological Survey, the geological research arm of the New York State   Museum, will contribute  to this effort as part of a coalition of 40 states organized to contribute to a  new National Geothermal Data System with relevant state-specific geothermal  data. The project, which will begin in New York by next summer,  will receive $17.79 million from the Department of Energy (DOE) over three  years under the auspices of consortium of states organized by the Association  of American State Geologists (AASG). </p>
<p>&ldquo;This project will help  us understand the geothermal potential in New York to an extent never before possible,&rdquo; said New York State  Geologist Bill Kelly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting to be part of this national effort, involving  other state geological surveys, to address such a critical energy need for the  state and the country.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Geothermal energy is  power extracted from heat stored in the earth. It is considered to be a  dependable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy source that has  become more accessible due to recent technological advances. Although  geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, the  emissions are much less than they would be with conventional fossil fuels. If  geothermal energy is widely used instead, it could help alleviate global  warming.</p>
<p>Compiling state-specific  geothermal data into integrated and searchable data systems distributed to  several locations around the country should drive renewed efforts to identify,  assess and exploit geothermal energy resources across America. This national collaboration of state and federal  agencies, universities, and industry, has the potential to reshape America&rsquo;s  energy landscape, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and leverage non-renewable  petroleum resources well into the 21st Century. </p>
<p>As a  member of AASG, the NYSGS is a partner in the Geothermal Data Coalition, based  at Boise State University,  which will design and build the National Geothermal Data System under contract  to DOE. AASG member surveys will adapt  the U.S. Geological Survey Geoscience Information Network to provide data  discovery, access, and exchange services as a component in the developing data  system. The U.S. Geoscience  Information Network is a collaboration between AASG and U.S. Geological  Survey online data providers and user  applications linked together by shared web services and interchange formats for  the purpose of finding, accessing, and using geoscientific information. <u> </u></p>
<p> The New York State   Museum is a cultural  program of the New York State Department of Education&rsquo;s Office of Cultural  Education. Founded in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating  state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located  on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be  obtained by calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
