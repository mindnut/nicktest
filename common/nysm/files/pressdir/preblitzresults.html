<title>First Capital Region BioBlitz a Success: 610 Species Documented on Peebles Island</title>

<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - Scientists and researchers identified at least 610 different species during the first Capital Region BioBlitz held at Peebles Island, State Museum officials announced today.</p>
<p>Held during a 24-hour period from July 30-31, scientists intensely canvassed the 158-acre state park on the Hudson River in Waterford. Plants are still being counted, so the number will grow. About 50 volunteers participated in the event in a cooperative effort. </p>
<p>"Capital Region BioBlitz 1999 was an incredible success," State Museum Director Cliff Siegfried said. "This demonstrates the rich diversity of species that exists so close to an urban environment."</p>
<p>The BioBlitz was organized by the New York State Biodiversity Research Institute (BRI) at the State Museum. The purpose of the BioBlitz was to generate public awareness to the concept of biodiversity -- the total variety of living organisms and the natural processes that support them. The data obtained is being used to complete a management plan for the park and may be used as the basis for future monitoring.</p>
<p>Museum officials hope to hold the event annually in the Capital Region. Plans are underway for Capital Region BioBlitz to be held in the spring at the Papscanee Island Nature Preserve in East Greenbush.</p>
<p>"We look forward to next year at Papscanee Island," organizer and BRI specialist Karen Frolich said. "There have been no species inventories there to date -- it is more undeveloped and unexplored."</p>
<p>Several interesting highlights of BioBlitz 1999 included:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The sighting of an osprey, which is listed in the state as a species of special concern.</p>
<li>An encounter with a woodchuck believed to be rabid. It was safely removed by animal control officers.</p>
<li>The discovery of Cosinodon cribrosus, a bryophyte, considered extremely rare.</p>
<li>The discovery of a blue crab, which is relatively uncommon north of Albany.</p>
<li>The sighting of a brook silverside fish in the Mohawk River. This is the only second time since the 1930s that the fish was caught in the Mohawk.</p>
<li>That the BioBlitz was held during the second driest summer on record in New York. Both days were hot and humid with highs above 90 degrees rendering all of the wetlands dry.</p>
</ul>
<p>"We want people to realize that there are often areas very close to their homes that support diverse amounts of life, even if they live in urban areas," biodiversity research specialist Ron Gill said.</p>
