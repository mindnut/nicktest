<p>ALBANY &ndash; The New York State Museum  will celebrate Charles Darwin&rsquo;s 200th birthday this February with an  innovative evolution series -- &ldquo;Cooking the Tree of Life&rdquo; &ndash; that includes a  recipe contest and cooking demonstrations.</p>
<p> Each demonstration in the weekly series will  pair a local chef with a biologist, and the two will prepare a meal, providing  both the culinary and scientific perspective. Each menu will focus on a different branch of  the Tree of Life &ndash; vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and fungi. The free  programs will be held each Wednesday, beginning Feb. 4, at 7 p.m. in the Clark  Auditorium. On Feb. 11, there will be a cake served in honor of the 200th  anniversary of Darwin&rsquo;s  birthday.</p>
<p> The Museum  also is sponsoring a &ldquo;Cooking the Tree of Life Recipe Contest,&rdquo; with  submissions due February 2. Contestants are invited to submit a recipe focusing  on the ingredients from one of the branches of the tree of life -- vertebrates,  invertebrates, plants and fungi. Recipes should include a description of why the  dish is biologically interesting. For example, the ingredients might be good  examples of artificial selection, illustrate a great amount of biodiversity, or  highlight some adaptation that allows a particular species to survive and  thrive (e.g. why some animals have white meat vs. dark meat). </p>
<p>The top submission will be featured in a live cooking  demonstration at the State   Museum in February. Also,  the winner will be filmed preparing a featured dish at the U.S. Foodservice  test kitchen. This video will be viewable through the State Museum  website after the event. Submissions should be sent to <a href="mailto:rkays@mail.nysed.gov">rkays@mail.nysed.gov</a> by February 2.</p>
<p>The February demonstrations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>February 4, vertebrates</strong>: Chef Tony Destratis of Lake       George Club will use a combination of familiar and unfamiliar vertebrates       to prepare a meal using meat. Dr. Roland   Kays, the Museum&rsquo;s curator of mammals, will assist.</li>
  <li><strong>February       11, invertebrates</strong>:<strong> </strong>Chef David Britton from Saratoga&rsquo;s Springwater       Bistro will try to set a world record for the most diverse meal ever       prepared since invertebrates are the most varied group of life on earth.       Dr. Jason Cryan, a Museum entomologist, will help steer the menu away from       the creepy-crawlies eaten on extreme reality shows and toward the more       appetizing branches of this part of the Tree of Life (think lobster).       </li>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>February       18, plants: </strong>Chef       Timothy Warnock, corporate chef for U.S. Foodservice, will use ingredients       from across the botanical Tree of Life to try to create the most       biodiverse meal anyone has seen. Dr. George Robinson, professor at the University of Albany, will guide the audience       through the 500 million years of plant life. </li>
  <li><strong>February       25, yeast and fungi: </strong>Chef Paul Parker from Chez Sophie plans to create one of the most       unusual meals of this series, promising a variety of tastes to match the       diversity of life represented in this category, which ranges from wine, to       bread, to mushrooms, to corn smut. Cornell University&rsquo;s       Dr. George Hulder, author of the book &ldquo;<em>Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous       Molds</em>,&rdquo; will offer the evolutionary color commentary as he helps chop       and stir the meal.</li>
