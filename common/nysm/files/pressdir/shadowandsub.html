<p style="text-align:justify;">ALBANY &ndash; A new  exhibition -- <em>Shadow and Substance:  African American Images from The Burns Archive</em> --  will open at the New York   State Museum  October 15, showcasing rarely-seen photographs from one of the largest private  photography collections in the world. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Open through March 31, 2012 in the  Photography Gallery, the exhibition allows the viewer to perceive how  African-Americans were seen by others and how they wished to be seen. These  images do not tell a complete story of the past, but their eloquent shadows  provide unique glimpses into the lives of African-Americans over the past 160  years. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  113 images in <em>Shadow and Substance</em> include portraits, snapshots and photographs of celebration, tragedy and quiet  joy, work and family, strength and perseverance. From early images of slaves  and Civil War soldiers to new voters and political activists, the exhibition is  filled with illustrations of achievement and shocking evidence of intolerance.  Some images may not be suitable for young children.</p>
<p>The  images were culled from the comprehensive Burns Archive of Historic Vintage  Photographs that include specializations  in medical and health care, death and dying, sports and recreation, in addition  to images of African-Americans. The collection was amassed by Dr. Stanley B.  Burns, an ophthalmologist, collector and curator in New   York City who was the founding donor for several photography  collections, including those of the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Bronx Museum  of the Arts. Burns has authored several books including &ldquo;A Morning&rsquo;s Work: Medical Photographs from the  Burns Archive &amp; Collection, 1843-1939&rdquo;; &ldquo;Sleeping Beauty: Memorial Photography in America&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forgotten Marriage: The Painted Tintype and  Decorative Frame, 1860-1910.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  traveling exhibition is organized by the Indiana  State Museum  and curated by Dr. Modupe Labode, assistant professor of history and public  scholar of African-American History and Museum Studies at Indiana University.</p>
<p>The State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, the Museum is open  Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is closed on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
