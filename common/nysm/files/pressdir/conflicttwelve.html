<p>ALBANY, NY  &ndash; &ldquo;Conflict, Catalyst, Conclusion: New York&rsquo;s  African-American Civil War Legacy&rdquo; will be presented February 18 at the New York State Museum  as part of the Museum&rsquo;s celebration of Black History Month. </p>
<p>Three college professors, who are experts in  19th-century African-American history, will participate in the  program from 10 a.m. to noon in the Huxley Theater. This free program is  sponsored by the State   Museum and the New York  State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.</p>
<p>The program will begin with a  dramatic presentation by Dr. David Anderson of Nazareth College.  He will then join Dr. Kate Clifford Larson of Simmons  College and Dr. Amy Murrell Taylor of  the University at Albany  for a panel discussion about the important role &ldquo;colored troops&rdquo; played in the  quest for emancipation. </p>
<p> The United States Colored Troops (USCT)  was the official name for African-American regiments in the U.S. Army during  the Civil War. First recruited in 1863, the USCT comprised one-tenth of the  Union Army by the end of the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln  authorized the recruitment of African-Americans to fight for the Union with the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1,  1863. For the first time African-Americans could legally fight in the Union  army against the Confederates. </p>
<p>Established in  1836, the State Museum is a program of the State  Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Located on Madison Avenue  in Albany, the  Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on  Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
