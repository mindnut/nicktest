<p style="text-align:justify;">The  New York State Museum will open a new exhibit on November 16 featuring a  selection of important New York State decorative and fine arts artifacts that  were recently donated to the Museum by Peter Wunsch, President of the Wunsch  Americana Foundation. Since 1969, the decorative and fine arts  collections of the State Museum have been enhanced by generous donations by the  Wunsch Americana Foundation under the direction of Eric Martin Wunsch. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  exhibit<em>, Building a Collection: E. Martin  Wunsch and His Passion for Collecting New York State Decorative Arts, </em>will be  on display through March 5, 2014. The Museum&rsquo;s Wunsch Collection  consists of furniture, paintings, silver, ceramics and folk art crafted  primarily between 1700 and 1900. The objects have labels indicating they were  made by New York craftsmen or have a documented New York history. The Wunsch  Collection illustrates changing stylistic trends in decorative arts and provides  insight into how New Yorkers once lived.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&ldquo;The Wunsch Collection is probably the most important  collection of New York State furniture and decorative arts in the nation,&rdquo; said  State Museum Director Mark Schaming. &ldquo;Donating to the Museum allowed Eric  Martin Wunsch the opportunity to collect antiques and preserve them for the  public to enjoy. The Board of Regents and the State Museum are grateful to the  Wunsch family for helping us preserve this important collection for future  generations.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eric Martin Wunsch passed away in March 2013 and his son,  Peter, generously donated the remaining pieces that were on long-term loan to  the Museum&rsquo;s collections. In addition to the exhibit, the Museum is hosting a  lecture series to honor the spirit of Wunsch and his life-long passion for  collecting American decorative arts.&nbsp; </p>
