<p>ALBANY, NY) Focus on Nature X: Natural History Illustration opens April 17 at the New York State Museum, showcasing world-class, juried artwork by top illustrators from 13 countries. </p>
<p>This exhibition, open through September 7 in Photograph Gallery will feature 94 natural history illustrations, representing the work of 83 illustrators from the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, Italy, South Korea, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa , and Spain. The organisms represented are diverse, ranging from mammals that are endemic to the artists&rsquo; home country -- numbats from Australia, and the crystal orchid from a single remote mountain in China -- to the ancient Roman lemons from Italy, rediscovered by the illustrator. </p>
<p>A five-member jury of artists and scientists selected the pieces on exhibit, based on the illustration&rsquo;s educational value and artistic quality. The exhibition&rsquo;s goal is to demonstrate the important role illustration has in natural science research and education, to stimulate curiosity about the world, and bring clearly into focus images of nature that people might not otherwise be able to visualize. Purchase Award(s) amounting to $20,000 will be presented by the Museum. The winning work(s) will be added to the museum's collections. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Natural history illustration has a story that parallels that of science,&rdquo; said Patricia Kernan, exhibition curator and scientific illustrator at the Museum. &ldquo;From the beginning, it has been an integral part of the research process, and the most efficient and effective means by which investigators communicate their research results. Today, illustrators have available the tools of developing technology, as well as the traditional media. The works in this exhibition are examples of how artists use these tools with ever wider and deeper levels of understanding and sophistication.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Kernan said many of the illustrations are created for field guides, textbooks, science articles and presentations. Some of these are included in the exhibition. A color catalog of illustrations in the exhibition will be available and can be ordered by visiting <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/publications/">http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/publications/</a>.</p>

It is held every two years and complements the biennial Northeast Natural History Conference on April 17-18 at the Empire State Plaza Convention Center, organized by the New York State Museum and the New York State Biodiversity Research Institute. The conference updates scientists, educators and students on research in the northeastern United States and Canada. More information on the conference can be found at . </p>
<p>The State Museum, a cultural program of the New York State Department of Education, was founded on a tradition of scientific inquiry. Started in 1836, the museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research and collection survey in the United States. The museum is located on Madison Avenue in Albany.
