<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Bicycle safety is the theme of the New York State Museum&rsquo;s next </p>
<p>Family Fun Weekend, June 2-3. <br />
    <br />
  Family Fun Weekend, presented by Fidelis Care, takes place from 1- 4 p.m. both </p>
<p>days. Activities, which are free of charge, are held mostly in Bird Hall, on the </p>
<p>Museum&rsquo;s first floor.<br />
    <br />
  On Saturday afternoon Michelle Stefanik, a Museum employee who is an experienced </p>
<p>cyclist, will use a course set up like streets to teach basic cycling practices. Her </p>
<p>demonstration will cover which way to face, how to signal and which lane to ride in. </p>
<p>Stefanik will also explain how to prepare a bicycle for riding by checking seat height, tire </p>
<p>pressure and brake pads. (Participants are asked not to bring a bicycle; this is only a </p>
<p>demonstration)</p>
<p>  At 2:30 p.m. Saturday the Brain Injury Association of New York State will present a </p>
<p>&ldquo;Kids on the Block&reg;&rdquo; puppet show. The troupe&rsquo;s program on brain injuries uses puppets </p>
<p>wearing helmets to talk about bicycle safety. &ldquo;Kids&rsquo;&rsquo; is an internationally-acclaimed </p>
<p>troupe that helps children understand their peers with disabilities.</p>
<p>  On Sunday afternoon, a New York State trooper will be on hand to discuss </p>
<p>family bicycle safety and answer questions. </p>
<p>  Young people will be given a special &ldquo;five-step tune-up&rdquo; packet of information on </p>
<p>how to tune up their bicycles, and a packet of puzzles, word searches and other activities. </p>
<p>They can also color bicycle safety sheets and make a stained glass bird, butterfly </p>
<p>or flower to take home and hang in a window. A scavenger hunt, with prizes, will be held </p>
<p>throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>  Family Fun Weekends, presented by Fidelis Care, offer theme-based family activities, </p>
<p>on the first weekend of the month. </p>
