<p><strong>Civil War Art at the New York State Museum: The Henry and Fay Collections</strong><br/>
Wednesday, November 20, 7 p.m.<br/>
Ronald Burch, senior historian and curator of art and architecture, will review the museum's collection of artwork by Edward Lamson Henry and John G. Fay. As young men, both witnessed Civil War action along Virginia's James River. Henry captured scenes of federal troop activity in 1864. A year earlier, Captain John G. Fay of Albany's Third Regiment, New York Infantry, saw and recorded action in the same area. Henry's sketches and Fay's watercolors will be on exhibit as an adjunct to the "<em>Eye of the Storm</em>" exhibition featuring the Civil War watercolors of Robert K. Sneden from the collection of the Virginia Historical Society.</p>
