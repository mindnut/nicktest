<p><strong></strong>(ALBANY, NEW YORK) -- A new exhibition -- <em>1934: A New Deal for Artists</em> -- will open at the New York State   Museum on October 19 showcasing  paintings created against the backdrop of the Great Depression with the support  of the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), the first federal government program  to support the arts nationally.</p>
<p> Open until  Jan. 20, 2013 in West Gallery, <em>1934: A New Deal for Artists</em> is organized and circulated by the Smithsonian American   Art Museum with support  from the William R. Kenan, Jr. Endowment Fund and the Smithsonian Council for  American Art. The C.F. Foundation in Atlanta  supports the Museum's traveling exhibition program, <em>Treasures to Go</em>.</p>
<p>During the Great Depression,  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt promised a &quot;new deal for the American  people,&quot; initiating government programs to foster economic recovery.  Roosevelt's pledge to help &quot;the forgotten man&quot; also embraced America's  artists. The Public Works of Art Project lasted only six months, from  mid-December 1933 to June 1934. Its purpose was to alleviate the distress of  professional unemployed American artists by paying them to capture &quot;the  American Scene&quot; in works of art that would embellish public buildings  across the country. Artists painted  regional, recognizable subjects &mdash; ranging from portraits, to cityscapes and  images of city life, to landscapes and depictions of rural life &mdash; that reminded  the public of quintessential American values such as hard work, community and  optimism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This exhibition is very timely,  opening in an election year when Americans are again grappling with questions  about what course the nation should take as it struggles to recover from the  worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, &ldquo;said State Museum Director  Mark Schaming. &ldquo;We think visitors will be inspired as they see this outstanding  artwork that bears witness to this New Deal cultural program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exhibition began a national tour  in 2010 celebrating the 75th anniversary of the PWAP by drawing on the Smithsonian   American Art    Museum&rsquo;s unparalleled collection of vibrant  paintings created for the program. The 55 paintings in the exhibition are a  lasting visual record of America  at a specific moment in time.</p>
<p>Artists  from across the United    States who participated in the program were  encouraged to depict &ldquo;the American Scene,&rdquo; but they were allowed to interpret  this idea freely. They painted regional, recognizable subjects&mdash;ranging from  portraits to cityscapes and images of city life to landscapes and depictions of  rural life&mdash;that reminded the public of quintessential American values such as  hard work, community and optimism. These artworks, which were displayed in  schools, libraries, post offices, museums and government buildings, vividly  capture the realities and ideals of Depression-era   America.</p>
<p>The  exhibition is arranged into eight sections: &ldquo;American People,&rdquo; &ldquo;City Life,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Labor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Industry,&rdquo; &ldquo;Leisure,&rdquo; &ldquo;The City,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Country&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The PWAP  employed artists from across the country including Ilya Bolotowsky, Lily Furedi  and Max Arthur Cohn in New York City; Harry Gottlieb and Douglass Crockwell in  upstate New York; Herman Maril in Maryland; Gale Stockwell in Missouri; E.  Dewey Albinson in Minnesota; E. Martin Hennings in New Mexico; and Millard  Sheets in California.</p>
<p>Ross  Dickinson paints the confrontation between man and nature in his painting of  southern California,  &ldquo;Valley Farms&rdquo; (1934). He contrasts the verdant green, irrigated valley with  the dry, reddish-brown hills, recalling the appeal of fertile California for many Midwestern farmers  escaping the hopelessness of the Dust Bowl.</p>
<p>Several artists chose to depict American ingenuity.  Stadium lighting was still rare when Morris Kantor painted &ldquo;Baseball at Night&rdquo;  (1934), which depicts a game at the Clarkstown Country Club&rsquo;s Sports Centre in  West Nyack, N.Y. Ray Strong&rsquo;s panoramic &ldquo;Golden Gate  Bridge&rdquo; (1934) pays homage to the  engineering feats required to build the iconic San Francisco structure. &ldquo;Old Pennsylvania  Farm in Winter&rdquo; (1934) by Arthur E. Cederquist features a prominent row of  poles providing telephone service and possibly electricity, a rare modern  amenity in rural America.</p>
<p>The program was open to artists who were denied other  opportunities, such as African- Americans and Asian-Americans. African-American  artists like Earle Richardson, who painted &ldquo;Employment of Negroes in  Agriculture&rdquo; (1934), were welcomed, but only about 10 such artists were employed by the project. Richardson,  who was a native New Yorker, chose to set his painting of quietly dignified  workers in the South to make a broad statement about race. In the Seattle area, where  Kenjiro Nomura lived, many Japanese-Americans made a living as farmers, but  they were subject to laws that prevented foreigners from owning land and other  prejudices. Nomura&rsquo;s painting &ldquo;The Farm&rdquo; (1934) depicts a darker view of rural  life with threatening clouds on the horizon.</p>
<p>During  its brief existence the PWAP hired 3,749 artists who created 15,663 paintings,  murals, sculptures, prints, drawings and craft objects at a cost of $1,312,000. </p>
<p>In  April 1934, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.,  exhibited more than 500 works created as part of the PWAP. Selected paintings  from the Corcoran exhibition later traveled to the Museum  of Modern Art in New York City and other cities across the  country. President Roosevelt, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and government  officials who attended the exhibition in Washington  acclaimed the art enthusiastically. The Roosevelts selected 32 paintings for  display at the White House, including Sheets&rsquo; &ldquo;Tenement Flats&rdquo; (1933-34) and  Strong&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Gate   Bridge&rdquo; (1934). The  success of the PWAP paved the way for later New Deal art programs, including  the Works Progress Administration&rsquo;s Federal Art Project. </p>
<p>Nearly  150 paintings from the PWAP were transferred to the Smithsonian American Art  Museum during the 1960s, along with a large number of artworks from subsequent  programs that extended into the 1940s, especially the well-known WPA program. </p>
<p>A  catalog, fully illustrated in color and co-published by the Smithsonian Art Museum  and D Giles Ltd. in London,  will be for sale in the Museum shop, in both the hard-cover and soft-cover  version. </p>
<p>The State Museum  will be sponsoring several programs to complement the exhibition including  tours of the exhibition on Oct. 20 and Nov. 17 and a Creative Art Day program  on Oct. 20.
