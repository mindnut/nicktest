<title>MASTODON TUSK MAY BE LARGEST EVER UNCOVERED IN NYS </title>

<p>ALBANY, N.Y.  &ndash; Research under way at the New York  State Museum  indicates that a huge mastodon tusk, recently excavated by Museum scientists in  Orange County,  may be the largest tusk ever found in New York State.</p>
<p> The nearly complete but fragmented tusk,  measuring more than 9 feet long, was one of two excavated this past summer in  the Black Dirt area of Orange County at the confluence of Tunkamoose Creek and  the Wallkill River, on the property of Lester Lain of Westtown. Museum  scientists believe that the other less complete tusk, about 5-6 feet long, came  from the same mastodon, which has been named the Tunkamoose mastodon. </p>
<p>Glen Keeton of Mount Hope,  N.Y. and Chris Connallon of Hampton,  N.J. came across the tusks in November 2008 as  they were canoeing down the Wallkill   River. Keeton contacted the  Orange County  chapter of the New York State Archeological Association, which then contacted  the State Museum. Weather conditions delayed the  excavation until this past summer.</p>
<p> Since then, Dr. Robert Feranec, the  Museum&rsquo;s curator of vertebrate paleontology, has been researching other  mastodon excavations in New York   State. Feranec believes  that the Warren Mastodon tusk, which is 8 feet, 8 inches long, is the longest  one uncovered to date. It was discovered in New York  State in the 1800s and is on exhibit  at the American Museum  of Natural History in New York City.  The tusk of the Cohoes Mastodon, on display at the State Museum,  is about 4-5 feet long. </p>
<p>Based  on the age of similar fossils, Feranec suspects that the tusks are about 13,000  years old. However, carbon dating results to determine the exact age, will not  be available until later this year. In the meantime, the tusks have been taken  apart to be cleaned and conserved for their long-term survival. It is hoped  that eventually the tusks can be made available for scientific research and  exhibits at the State   Museum and at a museum in  the area where the tusks were found. </p>
<p>Abundant  mastodon fossils have been found in Orange   County, especially in the  rich Black Dirt area which Keeton calls &ldquo;a gold mine for these fossils.&rdquo; Other  fossils have also been found including those of giant beavers, stag moose,  ground sloths, peccaries and reindeer.</p>
<p>Several  Museum scientists will be involved in an integrative research project in the  Black Dirt area where they will investigate the ancient environment in which  the mastodon lived, as well as how that environment changed over the last  13,000 years. </p>
<p> &ldquo;From  my perspective, this is a significant find,&rdquo; said Feranec. &ldquo;These fossils will  tell us more about the ancient history of New York. We hope to be able to reconstruct the  environment in which the mastodon lived, as well as to try to understand why  they went extinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p> In 2007, Feranec oversaw the  relocation of the Cohoes Mastodon from the State Museum  lobby window to its new location in the Museum&rsquo;s Exhibition Hall, where  temperature and humidity levels are more stable and more conducive to the  skeleton&rsquo;s long-term preservation. The iconic Museum treasure is now the  centerpiece of an expanded exhibition. Discovered in 1866 near Cohoes Falls,  the Mastodon once stood about 8 &frac12; feet tall, was about 15 feet long, and  weighed between 8-10,000 pounds. Its tusk weighs 50 pounds. </p>
<p> The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Founded  in 1836, the Museum has the longest continuously operating state natural  history research and collection survey in the U.S. Located on Madison Avenue  in Albany, the  Museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas  and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Further information can be obtained by  calling (518) 474-5877 or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>.</p>
