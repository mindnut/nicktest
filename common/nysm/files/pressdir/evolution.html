		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">ALBANY &ndash; Intelligent design in the classroom will be one of the topics discussed as part of a series of free weeknight February lectures on evolution commemorating the birthday of Charles Darwin at the New York State Museum. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> The debate over teaching evolution and/or intelligent design in the classroom rages on in more than 20 states across the country. State Museum biologist and evolution lecturer Dr. Jason Cryan will discuss this controversy in an analysis of current events on February 15th. </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> The Museum will celebrate Darwin&rsquo;s Feb. 12th birthday on Wednesday, Feb. 8th with a cake and commemorative lecture by Dr. Martin Wikelski, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University. Dr. Wikelski&rsquo;s lecture topic is &ldquo;Is Bigger Better? The Evolution of Galapagos Marine Iguanas.&rdquo; Body size is one of the most important characteristics of an animal. Dr. Wikelski will describe his discovery that some populations are ten times heavier than others. This is a story that involves shrinking animals, illicit sex, and even a major oil spill.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"> All lectures will be on Wednesdays at 7 p.m. in the Museum Theater. Free event parking is next to the Museum.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Other lecture topics are: </p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">? &ldquo;10 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know You Already Knew About Evolution&rdquo; on February 22. From sex, to food, to pets, many aspects of everyday life are shaped by principles so obvious that their evolutionary background may be unnoticed. Dr. Roland Kays, curator of mammals at the State Museum, will review the science behind ten of these surprising situations.</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">?|&ldquo;The Dark Side of Common Loons&rdquo; on March 1. Common loons are beautiful, considered symbols of wilderness waters, and the ideal parents. However, Wildlife Pathologist Ward Stone of the NY State Department of Environmental Conservation will describe their &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; that results in widespread wounding and some deaths in male and female loons and chicks. The potential evolutionary advantage of this extreme aggressive loon behavior will be discussed.</p>
