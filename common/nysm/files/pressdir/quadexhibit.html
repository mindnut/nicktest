<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; As part of the celebration of the 2009  Hudson-Champlain Quadricentennial celebration, the New York State Office of  Cultural Education (OCE) will present at the New York  State Museum  the exhibition &ldquo;<em>1609,&rdquo; </em>which will re-examine  Henry Hudson&rsquo;s voyage, the myths that surround it, and explore the legacies of Hudson&rsquo;s unexpected discovery.</p>
<p> The  State Museum, State Archives, State Library and State Office of Educational  Broadcasting, which make up OCE, are  collaborating on the <em>&ldquo;1609&rdquo;</em> exhibition.  It is scheduled to be open July 3, 2009 through March of 2010 in the Museum&rsquo;s  Exhibition Hall. </p>
<p> Other  quadricentennial events will include a two-month tour along the Hudson River  and Champlain Canal,  led by the New York   State Museum&rsquo;s  historic Day Peckinpaugh, a 259-foot, 1921 canal boat. The Half Moon, historic barges and other large  working boats will also participate in the tour in August and September 2009.  It will stop at 15 ports from Burlington, Vt. to New    York Harbor.  Visitors will be able to step onboard to view exhibits on 400 years of maritime  progress and advancement. The tour is organized by the Erie Canal National  Heritage Corridor, in conjunction with the State  Museum, Saratoga National   Historical Park  and the New York State Canal Corporation. </p>
<p> The <em>&ldquo;1609&rdquo;</em> exhibition will be presented in four parts. The first  section will focus on what life was like for both the Dutch and Native Peoples  of New York before 1609 and the events of that year. The visitor will then look  at the myths that Hudson  planned to come here, and that Native Americans greeted him and his crew with joy  and awe. The exhibition will attempt to dispel those myths and explore with the  visitor what is known about Hudson  and the 1609 voyage and the Native American response. The third section will  confront the myths relating to the short-term impact of the voyage &ndash; the  consequences for the Dutch and the Native Americans. Finally, the visitor will be  able to examine the long-term legacy of the Native Americans and Dutch, and how  they affected subsequent historical events and American culture  today.</p>
<p>In  addition to artifacts from throughout OCE collections, <em>&ldquo;1609&rdquo;</em> will also feature paintings by Capital District expert historical  artist L.F. Tantillo. </p>
<p>Archaeologist  James Bradley, an expert on Native Americans, and Russell Shorto, an authority  on colonial Dutch history, have written text for the exhibition. Bradley is the  author of &ldquo;<em>Before Albany: An Archaeology of Native-Dutch  Relations in the Capital Region 1600-1664</em>,&rdquo; and a guest curator for  portions of the exhibition. Shorto, who resides in the Netherlands, authored <strong>&ldquo;</strong><em>The Island  at the Center of </em><em>the World</em>,&rdquo; the epic story of Dutch Manhattan  and the forgotten colony that shaped America.</p>
<p>Steven  Comer, a Mohican Native American living within the original territory of the  Mohican people, has provided cultural information and consulting for the  project.</p>
<p> To complement the exhibition, the  Museum also will present a program, &ldquo;The Stars of 1609&rdquo; on Saturdays, May 2 and  30 and June 6 and 13 at 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. Participants will peer through the  ages to see the night sky as it looked to Henry Hudson and his crew in 1609.  There also will be a discussion about the navigational techniques of European  explorers, their tools and equipment and 17th-century astronomy. The program is  free but visitors must obtain tickets at the Museum&rsquo;s front lobby desk.</p>
