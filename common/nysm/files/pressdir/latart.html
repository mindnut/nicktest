  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - <em>"Uncovered Treasures: Contemporary Latino and Latin American Art,"</em> which includes some artists from the Capital District, opens at the New York State Museum Monday, September 23.</p>
<p>The exhibition, featuring internationally known artists, will be at the museum through December 1. It is a cooperative venture of the state museum, the state education department, the government of Puerto Rico and the Martinez Gallery of Troy. 
The art of Latin America is centuries old and combines rich traditions from Europe, Africa and the native peoples of the region. Latino artists of Latin American parentage, born in this country, combine elements from Latin America and the U.S.<p>
"Although Latin American art has recently become more popular with art collectors in the U.S. and Europe, it may not be as familiar to the general public," said Dr. Clifford Siegfried, museum director. "This exhibition provides the opportunity for museum visitors to become acquainted with a diverse collection of contemporary Latino art, including folk art on loan from the government of Puerto Rico."
Internationally known artists in this collection include painters German Perez of New York City, Alberto Mijangos, Angel Rodriguez-Diaz and photographer Kathy Vargas, all of San Antonio, Texas.
Other artists exhibiting are Armando Soto of Troy; Anthony Montes of Middle Grove in Saratoga County; Jamie Arredondo, Roxanna Melendez and Cesar Chelala, MD, all of New York City; Cruz Artiz of San Antonio; Mercedes Guerric of San Juan, Puerto Rico and Nora Quintero of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico. These artists work in a wide variety of styles, including abstract, magical realism, figurative, Latin pop culture and Chicano.</p>
<p>Laudelina Martinez, the owner of the Martinez Gallery, is the curator of the exhibition.
The 1300-square-foot Martinez gallery, in the Cannon Building at 3 Broadway in Troy, 
opened in April 2001. The gallery focuses on Latino and Latin American art but exhibits the 
work of other artists as well. It is open Thursday and Friday from 1 to 5 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>The New York State Museum, a cultural program of the New York State Department of Education, was founded on a tradition of scientific inquiry. Started in 1836, the museum has the longest continuously operating state natural history research and collection survey in the United States. The state museum is located on Madison Avenue in Albany. It is open daily from 9:30
a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
