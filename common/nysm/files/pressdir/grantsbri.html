<p>ALBANY, NY -- The New York State Biodiversity Research Institute (BRI) has awarded $547,255 in grant funds for biodiversity research, conservation and education efforts in New York State.<br />
These grants support research projects that will improve basic understanding of the variety of plants and animals that inhabit New York State. With this support, scientists will examine how threats, such as habitat fragmentation, residential development, invasive species, and mercury deposition affect a variety of species and natural communities in the state. They will also gather important baseline data that can be used to assess effects of climate change on the biodiversity of the state. These results will be used to better direct conservation efforts, such as prioritizing state land acquisition to preserve biodiversity and improve connections among habitats. Funds will also be used for a variety of projects that aim to educate the public about the importance of biodiversity and enable active participation in conservation.<br />
The Biodiversity Research Institute, based on the recommendations of leading researchers in the fields of environmental science and education, selected the following projects to support over the coming year:<br />

<p> The BRI serves as a comprehensive source of biological information, which is used to advise both public and private agencies on matters relating to the status of New York&rsquo;s biological resources. The New York State Legislature created the Institute in 1993 to help meet the challenges associated with preserving the state&rsquo;s biodiversity. The BRI is housed within the New York State Museum and is funded through the Environmental Protection Fund. The BRI is a collaboration between the State Museum, Department of Environmental Conservation, Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, State University of New York, New York Natural Heritage Program, American Museum of Natural History, Audubon New York, and The Nature Conservancy.
