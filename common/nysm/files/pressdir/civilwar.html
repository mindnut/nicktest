<div id="main"> <p>(ALBANY, NEW YORK)  <em>An  Irrepressible Conflict: The Empire State in the Civil War</em> opens September 22 at  the New York State Museum,  commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. </p>
<p>The pivotal role New    York State  played in the war is the focus of this 7,000-square-foot exhibition. As the  wealthiest and most populous state, the Empire State  led all others in supplying men, money, and mat&eacute;riel to the causes of unity and  freedom. New York&rsquo;s  experience provides significant insight into the reasons why the war was fought  and the meaning that the Civil War holds today. <em>An Irrepressible Conflict</em> will  be open through September 22, 2013 in Exhibition Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the  nation commemorates the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, it is  important that Americans everywhere are aware of the critical role New York played in this  defining moment of American history,&rdquo; said Museum Director Mark Schaming. &ldquo;This  expansive exhibition, together with a wide array of educational programs and  web-based resources, will present the rich and complex story of how New York led the way in  the fight for national unity and freedom for all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The exhibition includes objects from the collections of the State Museum,  Library and Archives, as well as others from institutions across the state. Among  the many significant objects are a Lincoln  life mask from 1860, the earliest photograph of Frederick Douglass (a rare 8-by-10-inch  daguerreotype image, courtesy of the Onondaga Historical Association) and the  only known portrait of Dred Scott. Additional support for this  exhibition is provided by RBC Wealth Management.</p>
<p>The  exhibition&rsquo;s title was inspired by<strong> </strong>an  1858 quote from then U.S. Senator William H. Seward, who also served as governor  of New York  (1839-42) and secretary of state (1861-69). Seward disagreed with those who  believed that the prospect of war between the North and South was the work of  &ldquo;fanatical agitators.&rdquo; He understood that the roots of conflict went far deeper,  writing, &ldquo;It is an irrepressible conflict, between opposing and enduring  forces.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>An Irrepressible Conflict</em> will be organized around  three themes &mdash;<strong> </strong>Antebellum New York, The Civil  War 1861-1865 and Reconstruction and Legacy<strong>.</strong> Over 200 objects, documents and images will be  on display. The exhibition includes profiles of significant historical figures who  played key roles in the war effort, but will also include the personal stories  of previously unknown soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibition Details --</strong></p>
<p><strong>Antebellum New York </strong></p>
<p>Antebellum  New York covers New York&rsquo;s history of slavery and its role  in the national debate over slavery. New York, once the  largest slave state in the North, became a center for abolitionism and other  reform movements. The exhibition focuses on Seward, Underground Railroad  &ldquo;conductor&rdquo; Harriet Tubman and abolitionists, such as Frederick Douglass and  Gerrit Smith who were active at the same time many New Yorkers profited from  their business relationships with Southern slaveholders. In the end, the  differences between opponents and supporters of slavery would become an  &ldquo;irrepressible conflict&rdquo; for New Yorkers and all Americans. </p>
<p>Among  the artifacts displayed is a brass slave collar, c.1806, inscribed &ldquo;J.S.  glenn/GLENN/Montgomery Co. NY.&rdquo; There also is a broadside, loaned by the  Onondaga Historical Association, establishing a reward for the return of Harriet  Powell, whose escape from slavery in October 1839 helped establish Onondaga County&rsquo;s national reputation as a center  for the abolitionist movement. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Antebellum  New York also chronicles the state&rsquo;s rise,  after the opening of the Erie Canal, as the  most populous and productive state in the nation. It focuses on the rising  tensions between immigrants and native-born Americans, antebellum politics and  the 1860 election of President Abraham Lincoln. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Civil War 1861-1865</strong></p>
<p>The  Civil War 1861-1865 era recounts New    York&rsquo;s pivotal role in the war effort, examining the  contributions of New Yorkers on the battlefield and home front. As the most  populous state, New York  was required to furnish more men than any other state. While united in battle  to preserve the nation, New Yorkers were torn over the same issues that divided  them before the war. In order for the North to emerge victorious, however,  these divisions &ndash; between immigrant and native-born, rich and poor,  abolitionist and anti-abolitionist, Republic and Democrat &ndash; had to be overcome. </p>
<ul>
  <li>On  display is a colorful broadside from Glens    Falls asking &ldquo;Are You Ready to Stand by the Stars and  Stripes,&rdquo; courtesy of the State Library. Visitors will also see a flag, loaned  by the New York State Military   Museum, from the 11th  New York Volunteer Infantry. This regiment was raised and commanded by Elmer  Ellsworth, originally from Malta,  Saratoga County, who became the war&rsquo;s first  martyr. Ellsworth was fatally shot tearing down a Confederate flag from the  Marshall House hotel in Virginia,  and became the first Union officer killed. </li>
  <li>Spotlighted  in this area of the exhibition are former Albany Mayor, Congressman and  railroad magnate Erastus Corning and Dr. Mary Walker, an Army surgeon who was the  only woman ever to receive the nation&rsquo;s highest military award &ndash; the Medal of  Honor. </li>
  <li>New York&rsquo;s shipbuilding, iron and firearms industries  played a vital role in the war effort. The Civil War marked a transition in  naval warfare &ndash; from wooden sailing and steam ships to heavily armored  ironclads. On display, courtesy of the Hudson Mohawk Industrial Gateway, is an  iron plate, reportedly rolled for the nation&rsquo;s first ironclad ship, the U.S.S.  Monitor, at the Corning &amp; Winslow foundry in Troy,  Rensselaer County. The exhibition also includes a Model 1863  Percussion Rifle, manufactured in Ilion, by E.  Remington &amp; Sons. New York   State gunsmiths dominated  the firearms industry throughout the first half of the 19th century and used  these new and emerging technologies to equip Union soldiers with the latest  equipment. </li>
  <li>The  exhibition focuses on several infantry units from New York, as well as the roles played by  individual soldiers. On display, courtesy of the St. Lawrence County Historical  Association, is a snare drum used by Private David Lyons of the 60th  New York Volunteer Infantry. There also is a photo of a Broadside Ballad, the  Drummer of Antietam, courtesy of the State Library. Broadside ballads were one  good way of disseminating news throughout the war.</li>
  <li>When  the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, it not only freed slaves but  authorized the recruitment of African-American soldiers. Three regiments of  U.S. Colored Troops were raised in New    York. On display are Muster Roll abstracts from the  collections of the State Archives for individual soldiers in the 26th and 31st  U.S. Colored Troops.</li>
  <li>The  exhibition chronicles the story of the Elmira Prison Camp, which opened in July  1864 to accommodate the government&rsquo;s increasing numbers of rebel prisoners.  Originally a barracks for 5,000 men, Elmira  &ndash; known as &ldquo;Hellmira&rdquo; by its inmates &ndash; eventually housed over 12,000  Confederate soldiers. Nearly 25 percent of them died from malnutrition,  exposure and disease. A restraining chain from the prison, courtesy of the  Chemung County Historical Society, is among the artifacts on display.</li>
  <li>President  Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination occurred just days after the war ended. Photographs and  other artifacts are on display relating to this tragic episode in the nation&rsquo;s  history. Lincoln&rsquo;s funeral train made stops in  12 cities, including New York City, Albany and Buffalo. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reconstruction and Legacy</strong></p>
<p> Reconstruction and Legacy, the  exhibition&rsquo;s final section, chronicles the impact the war had on New Yorkers.  By the war&rsquo;s end, 448,000 New Yorkers had enlisted in the armed services, and  more than 50,000 of them had died. <strong></strong></p>
<p>Thousands  of Civil War veterans also returned home with injuries or disabilities. Some needed  long-term care that was more than their families could provide. New York passed legislation in 1872 to construct a home  for these soldiers in Bath, Steuben County.  A wheelchair from the home, courtesy of Edwin Presley, will be on display in  this area of the exhibition. </p>
<p>The  exhibition shows how memories of the war changed with the times. It focuses on Reconstruction,  continuing prejudices and the struggle for equality, the Civil Rights Era and  the meaning and relevance of the war today. </p>
<p>The State   Museum, State Library and  State Archives are planning a variety of programs to complement the exhibition  including lectures, guided tours for students, and educational activities for  children and families. There also is an online exhibition and web resources for  students and teachers, including downloadable packets of materials for pre-and  post-visit classroom activities.
