<title>NEW YORK STATE MUSEUM STUDY SUGGESTS WOLVES MIGRATING EAST</title>

<div id="main"> <p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; Researchers at the New York State Museum recently  published a new study indicating that some wolves have migrated into New York  state and other areas of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Museum curators Dr. Roland Kays and Dr.  Robert Feranec used a new isotope test for the first  time to determine whether eight wolves found in the Northeast over the last 27 years  had been living in the wild or had escaped from captivity. This is an important  question for species, such as wolves, that are not known to breed in New York state, but are  occasionally discovered here. Results revealed that three of the eight wolves  tested were probably natural immigrants because they had a history of eating wild  foods. One of these wild wolves was found  in Saratoga County  in 2001 and the other two came from Vermont  in 1998 and 2006. The isotope signatures  of five others suggested they had been eating food in captivity, and were  therefore probably escaped pets or zoo animals.  Kays and Feranec documented their work in a new article published in the <em>Northeastern Naturalist</em>, a  peer-reviewed and edited online journal with a regional focus on northeastern North America. The abstract is available at <a href="http://www.eaglehill.us/NENAonline/articles/NENA-18-3/10-Kays.shtml">http://www.eaglehill.us/NENAonline/articles/NENA-18-3/10-Kays.shtml</a>. </p>
<p>Wolves have been extinct in the  Northeastern U.S. since the late 1800s but survive to the north in Ontario and Quebec, and  have recently been expanding in the Great Lakes.  Although this research shows that there have been at least three naturally  immigrating wolves in the Northeast, there is no evidence at this point to  suggest that there is an established breeding population. Rather, it is likely  that these few wolves migrated to the Northeast from the Great Lakes area or  from Canada,  looking for potential mates. </p>
<p>Citing other studies, Kays and  Feranec note that the recent recovery of wolves throughout much of the Great Lakes region and increased protection of wolves  in Ontario  make it likely that even more wolves will migrate into the Northeastern   U.S. in the near future. &ldquo;There is substantial suitable habitat in Northern New York and New England  that could support a viable population of wolves&rdquo; says Kays.</p>
<p>If wolves were to become established, this new  top predator would probably reduce coyote populations in the Northeast and  change the behavior and densities of other prey, such as deer. </p>
<p> Feranec says that the new isotope  test that they used &ldquo;is based on the principle that you are what you eat&rdquo; and  involves measuring the carbon isotopes of hair and bone fragments of the wolves.  Animals that eat corn-based pet food or grain-fed  livestock accumulate a different carbon isotope in their bodies than those who  find their own food in the wild. The isotopes in the hair represent the animals&rsquo;  diet since its last molt, while those in the bone represent a lifetime average  of the animals&rsquo; diet. </p>
<p> Kays  and Feranec also used this new isotope test to show that a cougar found in Connecticut this past  June had spent its life eating typical wild prey, and was not a captive animal  that had escaped or been released. The test was requested by the Wildlife Division  of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP),  and confirmed genetic and other evidence showing that this was a wild cougar  from South Dakota that migrated through the  Great Lakes and New York State, before being hit by a car in Connecticut.</p>
<p> The New York State   Museum is a program of  the New York State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. Located on Madison Avenue in Albany, it is open Monday  through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. It is closed on Thanksgiving,  Christmas and New Year's Day.
