<p>ABANY, NY &ndash; The New  York State Museum will present a film Sunday, Nov. 18 documenting the gripping  expedition of 11 wounded Iraqi and Afghanistan War veterans, a Gold Star mother  and a blind adventurer who climb a 20,000-foot Himalayan mountain in an attempt  to heal the emotional and physical scars of war.</p>
<p> &ldquo;High  Ground&rdquo; will be shown Nov. 18 at 1 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. Albany native Scott Watts, the coordinating  producer, will introduce the film, which was produced by Don Hahn (The Lion  King). Following the 92-minute free screening, News Channel 13 co-anchor Benita  Zahn will lead a Q&amp;A discussion featuring a panel of Capital Region  veterans including First Sergeant (Retired) Pat Abrams, Major Joseph Chodnicki,  Staff Sergeant Kelly Kenyon and Specialist Dan Swift. Scott Watts, the film&rsquo;s  coordinating producer, will also participate.</p>
<p> The film  chronicles a showcase expedition called &ldquo;Soldiers to Summit&rdquo; that brings together war veterans and  world-recognized climbers to demonstrate what can be achieved by climbing a  Himalayan mountain. In October 2010, ten  years after blind adventurer Erik Weihenmayer made his historic ascent of  Everest, the same team of mountain guides who assisted Weihenmayer reunited to  lead the group of warriors. The event was organized with the help of World  T.E.A.M. Sports, a veterans support organization. </p>
<p>Representing all four branches of the  military, the veterans and the Gold Star mother set out to climb the peak of Lobuche East, 8.7 miles from Everest.  Director Michael Brown, a three-time Emmy winner, captured the breathtaking,  vertigo-inducing cinematography as the team makes its way high into the  Himalayan mountains through the villages of Nepal, over raging rivers and up  terrifying steep terrain. </p>
<p> The film allows  veterans to tell their stories in their own way and in their own words. The  mountain itself is a metaphor for one of the basic concepts of military action  &ndash; the high ground is the safest, most defensible place with the greatest  perspective. </p>
<p> Those wishing to attend the program are asked  to register by Friday, Nov. 16 by calling (518) 474-0076. More information on  the film is available at <a href="http://www.highgroundmovie.com/">http://www.highgroundmovie.com/</a></p>
