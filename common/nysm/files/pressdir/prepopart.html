<p>ALBANY, NY - Warhol, Lichtenstein, Oldenburg and Wesselmann. Some of the greatest names in Pop Art are coming to the New York State Museum thanks to a generous grant from Fleet, museum and bank officials announced today.</p>
<p>Pop Art: Selections from The Museum of Modern Art will be featured at the State Museum, a program of the New York State Education Department, from Feb. 26 to May 2, 1999, in the first of a series of exhibits from New York City art museums through 2001 sponsored by Fleet.</p>
<p>The Fleet Great Art Exhibition and Education Program has been made possible through a $450,000 grant, most to be used over the next three years to bring exceptional shows to the State Museum.</p>
<p>"The State Museum is thrilled to present these great works of art from the world class collection of The Museum of Modern Art," said Mark Schaming, the State Museum's Director of Exhibitions. "Our visitors will have the unique opportunity to view memorable paintings and sculptures never before seen in the Capital District in this ongoing series of exhibits."	</p>
<p>"Fleet is very proud to partner with the New York State Museum in support of the Fleet Great Art Series," stated Herm Ames, President of Fleet National Bank (New York Region). "At Fleet, we are committed to making arts and cultural events accessible in our community. By bringing important art exhibits to the Museum and the Capital District, we are providing an opportunity for our children to not only study examples of great art in their schools, but to see them in person; for our senior citizens to visit a local museum rather than make a long journey to New York City; and for visitors to regard the Capital District as more of a culturally significant destination. At Fleet, we are committed to providing these art exhibits free to the public, ensuring that truly everyone has the opportunity to experience these important collections."</p>
<p>The series could not have been made possible without the leadership of state Sen. Roy M. Goodman, R-Manhattan, who initiated these exhibits by encouraging the museums to share their treasures.</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful to The Museum of Modern Art for making available this marvelous exhibit of work by Pop artists," Goodman said. "We are delighted that this great museum is part of our program to make important art available to the public at the State Museum in Albany."</p>
<p>The State Museum will offer educational programs for both adults and children centered on Pop Art and the continuing shows brought to Albany through the Fleet Great Art series.</p>
<p>"With this very generous gift, Fleet once again demonstrates its commitment to excellence in education and exhibitions in our community," Museum Institute Executive Director Laurie Roberts said.</p>
<p>Pop Art will feature 28 works from MoMA's renowned collection - all created in the U.S. during the 1960s - the defining decade of this movement.</p>
<p>The exhibition will include key figures in Pop Art, such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Indiana and Tom Wesselmann.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights include Warhol's famous series of thirty-two Campbell's Soup Cans, 1962, and Self-Portrait, 1966; Wesselmann's well-known Still Life #30; and Oldenburg's Giant Soft Fan, 1966-67.</p>
<p>"The New York State Museum and The Museum of Modern Art share a commitment to education in this state, so we couldn't be more pleased that Pop Art will be shown in Albany, our state capital. This is the first in what we hope will be a series of exhibitions designed to share MoMA's world-renowned collection with the people of Albany," remarked Glenn D. Lowry, the director of MoMA.</p>
<p>Along with Goodman, Harry M. Rosenfeld, editor-at-large of the Times Union of Albany, helped the State Museum reach this exciting partnership with these institutions.</p>
<p>	"The new funding helps to assure the long-range presentation of the finest art works in the Great Art series," Rosenfeld said. "The contributions are greatly appreciated as the State Museum develops its growing relationships with all the world-class museums in New York City for the cultural enrichment of everyone residing in the Capital Region, as well for visitors who come our way."</p>
