<p>ALBANY, N.Y. - <em>All Stars:American Sporting Prints from the Collection of Reba and Dave Williams </em>tells the story of sports in America from the late 19th century through the late 20th century through the eyes of printmakers. The exhibition will be at the New York State Museum from <strong>July 7 through Oct. 28, 2001</strong> in the Photography Gallery.</p>
<p>There were few "sports" in the United States before the Civil War. Society and its attitude toward sports began to change when America eased into the Gilded Age, which brought with it prosperity and greater leisure. <em>All Stars</em> provides insights into American culture and social history and illustrates how the increase in leisure time in America gave rise to the popularity of sports and, subsequently, of depictions of sports in art.</p>
<p>The exhibition, including such artists as Winslow Homer, George Bellows, Childe Hassam, Alex Katz and Robert Rauschenberg, brings together 66 prints by 52 artists and features images of more than 30 sports, including baseball, tennis, polo, wrestling, cycling and hockey. The exhibition encompasses the entire spectrum of print processes and many major art styles of the 20th century. </p>
<p>The exhibition is culled from the collection of Reba and Dave Williams. The entire collection numbers over 5,000 prints and includes the work of more than 2,000 artists. In addition to being collectors, the Williamses are avid art history researchers and article writers. Reba Williams has served on the New York State Council on the Arts and was President of the New York City Art Commission.</p>
<p>"Almost everyone is interested in sports, and these artists have tried to capture the vitality, energy and excitement of athletic events in their prints," Ms. Williams said. "We think <em>All Stars </em>is great fun, and hope visitors will enjoy it."</p>
