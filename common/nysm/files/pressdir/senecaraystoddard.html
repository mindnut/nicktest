<p>ALBANY,  NY &ndash; A new exhibition opens on June 29 at the New York State  Museum showcasing the works of  Adirondack photographer and conservationist Seneca Ray Stoddard, who was  instrumental in the establishment of the &ldquo;forever wild&rdquo; Adirondack Park.</p>
<p> Seneca Ray  Stoddard: Capturing the Adirondacks  is open through February 24,  2013 in Crossroads Gallery. It includes over 100 of Stoddard&rsquo;s photographs,  an Adirondack guideboat, freight boat, camera,  copies of Stoddard&rsquo;s books and several of his paintings. There also are several  Stoddard photos of the Statue of Liberty and Liberty   Island. These and other items come from the State  Museum&rsquo;s collection of more than 500  Stoddard prints and also from the collections of the New York State Library and  the Chapman Historical  Museum in Glens Falls.</p>
<p> &ldquo;This is the first time the State Museum  has exhibited these remarkably important photographs from our extensive Seneca  Ray Stoddard collection,&rdquo; said Museum Director Mark Schaming. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an  enormously rich visual turn-of-the century record of the Adirondacks,  as well as other magnificent regions of the state. Stoddard&rsquo;s work continues to be an important  resource in understanding the history and development of the Adirondack  region.&rdquo; </p>
<p>An  online version of the exhibition is also available on the State Museum  website at</p>

<p> Born  in Wilton, Saratoga  County in 1844, Stoddard was no doubt  inspired by the Adirondacks at an early age. A  self-taught painter, he was first employed as an ornamental painter at a  railroad car manufactory in Green   Island. He moved to Glens Falls in 1864,  where he worked with sketches and paintings until his death there in 1917. </p>
<p> Early  on he sought to preserve the beauty of the Adirondacks  through his paintings but then became attracted to photography&rsquo;s unique ability  to capture the environment. He was one of the first to capture the Adirondacks through photographs. He used the then recently introduced wet-plate  process of photography. Though extremely cumbersome by today&rsquo;s standards, the  technique was the first practical way to record distant scenes. It required  Stoddard to bring his entire darkroom with him into the Adirondack  wilderness. </p>
<p>His renown as a  photographer quickly grew once he settled in Glens Falls,  which also became his base camp for his  explorations of the Adirondacks. He studied  the Adirondacks intensely over a 50-year  period. </p>
<p>Stoddard&rsquo;s photos  showed the challenges travelers faced in getting to the still undeveloped  wilderness, along with their enjoyment of finally reaching their destination. His  writings and photographs indicate that he was especially skilled at working  with people from diverse economic backgrounds in a variety of settings. This  was especially important as he used his photos to capture the changing Adirondack landscape as railroads were introduced and the  area became an increasingly important destination for the burgeoning  middle-class tourist, but also for the newly wealthy during the &ldquo;Gilded Age.&rdquo; </p>
<p>His work  stimulated even further interest as he promoted the Adirondacks  through his photographs and writings on the beauty, people and hotels of the  region. Stoddard&rsquo;s photographs showed the constancy of the natural beauty of  the Adirondacks along with the changes that resulted  from logging and mining, to hotels and railroads. As unregulated mining and  logging devastated much of the pristine Adirondack  scenery, Stoddard documented the loss and used those images to foster a new  ethic of responsibility for the landscape. His work was instrumental in shaping  public opinion about tourism, leading to the 1892 &ldquo;Forever Wild&rdquo; clause in the  New York State Constitution. </p>
<p>The State Museum  purchased over 500 historic Stoddard prints in 1972 in the process of acquiring  historic resources for the Museum&rsquo;s Adirondack Hall. They included albumen  prints from Stoddard&rsquo;s own working files, many with penciled notes. Nearly all  are of the landscapes, buildings and people of the Adirondacks  taken primarily in the 1870s and 1880s. </p>
<p>The State Museum  will present several programs in conjunction with the Stoddard exhibition. There  will be guided tours of the exhibition on September 8 and December 8 from 1-2  p.m. Stoddard will also be the focus of Family Fun Day on September 15 from1-4  p.m.</p>

Located on Madison Avenue in Albany,  the Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on  Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free.
