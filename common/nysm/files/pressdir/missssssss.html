<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; A  national expert known for his success in helping to solve long-standing missing  persons&rsquo; cases will speak to families and friends of abducted children and  other missing persons at the 8th annual Missing Persons&rsquo; Day  ceremony Sunday, April 5 at the New    York State Museum. </p>
<p> The event is held in conjunction  with Missing Persons<strong>&rsquo; </strong>Day, which is observed  annually on April 6th, Suzanne Lyall&rsquo;s birthday. The former SUNY  Albany student has been missing since March 2, 1998.</p>
<p>Todd Matthews, known for his involvement in the &ldquo;Tent  Girl&rdquo; case, will be the featured speaker at 2 p.m. in the Huxley Theater. The  &ldquo;Tent Girl&rdquo; was an unidentified young woman found dead near Georgetown, Kentucky  on May 17, 1968. As a result of the ongoing efforts of Matthews, she was  positively identified 30 years later, in 1998, as Barbara Ann Hackmann Taylor.</p>
<p>Matthews  will talk about his work as media director for the Doe Network, which maintains  a searchable database of information about missing persons. He is a consultant  on a new TV series being developed by Dick Wolf, producer of the TV show &ldquo;Law  and Order,&rdquo; and he is on the advisory board of the U.S. Department of Justice&rsquo;s  NamUs.gov (National Missing and Unidentified Persons System) database project.  A documentary film about Matthews&rsquo; life, entitled &ldquo;Resurrection,&rdquo; is currently  in production.</p>
<p>Prior  to Matthews&rsquo; speech, a ceremony will be held in the Museum&rsquo;s Huxley Theater,  beginning at 1 p.m., with Assembly Minority Leader James Tedisco as master of  ceremonies. It will include a talk by Doug and Mary Lyall, the parents of  Suzanne Lyall, who will discuss the Center for Hope, the Ballston Spa-based  non-profit organization they founded. This will be followed by remarks by  Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings and Albany County District Attorney David Soares.</p>
<p>Following the speeches and presentations, members of  families with missing loved ones will place wreaths of yellow roses and hold a  candlelight vigil at the Missing Persons&rsquo;<strong> </strong>Remembrance monument, located on the southeast corner of Madison and Swan  Streets. Constructed in 2006, the monument features an eternal flame to &ldquo;light the way home&rdquo; for the missing.</p>
<p>The New York State Police, the Department of Criminal  Justice Services (DCJS), and other organizations will be present during the  event to hand out literature and answer parents&rsquo; questions. Jim Viola, a  filmmaker and husband of Patricia Viola, who has been missing from Bogota, New    Jersey since 2001, will present several short videos  about a variety of missing persons&rsquo; cases.</p>
<p>The  Museum is among several sites in the Capitol Region that hosts a computer kiosk  that allows visitors to access information year-round about missing persons.</p>
<p>During  the morning of April 5, nearly 200 survivors and friends of missing persons,  are expected to attend a private morning session exclusively for the families  and missing person organizations, sponsored by the Center for Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The families of missing persons share a common bond -- pain,  anger, sorrow and the agony of losing a loved one,&rdquo; said Mary Lyall. &ldquo;Each  family has a story to tell about people who are hurting because their missing  loved ones have not come home. The annual Missing Persons&rsquo; Day event offers  these people hope, support and guidance.&rdquo;</p>
