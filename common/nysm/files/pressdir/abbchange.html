<p>ALBANY, NY &ndash; <em>Berenice Abbott&rsquo;s Changing New York: A  Triumph of Public Art</em> opens in the New York State   Museum&rsquo;s Crossroads  Gallery June 13 showcasing what is considered  to be one of the monumental achievements of 20th century  photography.</p>
<p> The exhibition, open  through October 4, features 40 original photographs taken by Abbott when she  was employed from 1935 to 1939 by the Federal Art Project (FAP) of the Works  Progress Administration (WPA) to capture the rapidly changing urban scene in  New York City. In addition to photographs in the State  Museum&rsquo;s collection from this  Depression-era project, which Abbott called &ldquo;Changing New York,&rdquo; the exhibition  will also include additional images from the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY).</p>
<p> Born in 1898 in  Springfield, Ohio, Abbott left Ohio State University after one year and moved  to Greenwich Village at age 19 to become an artist in New York City. In 1921  she joined the bohemian exodus to Paris  where she worked as a darkroom assistant to successful photographer Man Ray.  After three years, she had become a skilled photographer and opened her own  studio. Soon her reputation rivaled that of her mentor.</p>
<p>Through Ray she  met Euge?ne Atget, an elderly photographer who had spent years documenting Paris. When Atget died in  1927, Abbott salvaged the contents of his studio and made his work her cause. </p>
<p> In 1929, after eight  years in Europe, Abbott returned to New    York City for what she expected would be a short  visit. But during her absence, hundreds of 19th-century buildings  had been razed to make way for dozens of skyscrapers, and the unprecedented  building boom inspired her to give up a thriving Parisian portrait practice to  photograph the new face of New York.  She was inspired by Atget&rsquo;s documentation of Paris. </p>
<p> Soon after her return,  the Stock Market crashed, the Great Depression began, and Abbott struggled for five years to pursue her project. In 1935, she was offered the  financial and staff support she needed to continue her project by the FAP, a work-relief program for  artists under the auspices of the WPA. But, although Abbott was an FAP star  whose works were featured in exhibitions and a book, <em>&ldquo;Changing New York,&rdquo;</em> Abbott lost her FAP support in 1939 due to budget cuts.</p>
<p> She was able to complete  her project by 1940, creating two sets of 305 exhibition prints for her  sponsor, the Museum of the City of New York, and  a partial set for the State   Museum. She then worked  for two decades inventing ways to visualize scientific phenomena. In 1958, the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology hired her to illustrate an innovative  physics textbook and a series of popular books. In 1961 she retired in Maine, where she lived  to age 93.</p>
<p> The Museum will sponsor  several programs to complement the exhibition. <a name="OLE_LINK2" id="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1" id="OLE_LINK1">&ldquo;</a>Creative  Art Day&rdquo; participants will meet at the Crossroads Gallery to visit the <em>Berenice Abbott</em> exhibition on Saturday,  August 29 from 1 to 3 p.m. During this free program families participate in artful activities. </p>
<p>During the Wednesday, August 12  session of &ldquo;Creative  Quest: Museum Art Camp&rdquo; students will focus on urban photography and the <em>Berenice Abbott</em> exhibition. During this  program, students are taught about history through creative art projects  focused on a specific theme. There also are sessions relating to other exhibition  galleries planned for Monday, August 10 and Friday, August 14. There is a fee.

<p>Also,  this fall, Bonnie Yochelson, the consulting historian for the <em>Berenice Abbott</em> exhibition, will present  a public program in conjunction with the exhibition, sponsored by the New York  State Archives Partnership Trust. </p>
