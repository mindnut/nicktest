<p>ALBANY, NY -- &ldquo;Farmers, Warriors, Builders: The Hidden Life of Ants&rdquo; will  open at the New York State Museum January 29 showcasing the photography of ant  expert Dr. Mark Moffett, an award-winning photojournalist, ecologist and  explorer.</p>
<p> The  exhibition is organized by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition  Service (SITES) and the Smithsonian&rsquo;s National Museum of Natural History. It  will be open at the State   Museum through April 10  and then continue on a 15-city national tour through 2015.</p>
<p>  Moffett&rsquo;s  macro photographs chronicle the work of entomologists in the field and tell  incredible stories about the lives of ants &mdash; hunting, communicating, dealing  with disease and agriculture. The  exhibition features 39 large-scale color photographs, a touchable three-dimensional  aluminum cast of an ant nest, and a touchable oversized ant model. Visitors can  explore the model of a leaf cutter worker ant that has been blown up to 50  times its actual size, and learn how it uses its body to work and survive in  the colony.</p>
<p> A real-life  adventurer who has been called &ldquo;the Indiana Jones of entomology&rdquo; by the  National Geographic Society, Moffett has won the highest honors in exploration  &ndash; the 2006 Lowell Thomas Medal from the Explorers Club and Rolex, and the  Chapman Andrews Society Distinguished Explorer Award (2008). </p>
<p> He received a  doctorate from acclaimed conservationist Edward O. Wilson at Harvard University  and remains active in science with over 80 peer-reviewed publications. He has  written more than 25 articles for National Geographic Magazine, which has  featured nearly 500 of his images. He also has appeared on the Conan O&rsquo;Brien  show, twice on the Colbert Report and on NPR. His most recent book, &ldquo;Adventures Among Ants: A Global Safari  With a Cast of Trillions,&rdquo; won the National Outdoor Book Award.
