<p>ALBANY - Dr. Cliff Siegfried, who has led research on aquatic ecology for 20 years at the New York State Museum, was today named Assistant Commissioner for Museums and Director of the museum, Cultural Education Deputy Commissioner Carole Huxley announced.</p>
<p>The New York State Board of Regents unanimously approved her recommendation at their meeting in Queens earlier today to ratify Dr. Siegfried's appointment to oversee operations of the Museum, a program of the State Education Department. </p>
<p>"As one who credits public education opportunities through the graduate level with his success as a scientist, Dr. Siegfried brings to this position a deep personal dedication to the Education Department's mission -- 'To raise the knowledge, skill and opportunity of all the people in New York.' He is committed to enlarging educational access through the informal, individual learning museums provide," Huxley said.</p>
<p>"In his tenure here, he has been adept at forging partnerships to attain major program objectives, has secured significant support for research at the Museum and enjoys the widespread respect of his peers and colleagues," Huxley said. "I join all of them in my pleasure at his appointment and in my expectations that Dr. Siegfried will provide strong leadership for the State Museum and for museums statewide."</p>
<p>Dr. Siegfried, 51, of Altamont was chosen from an impressive array of candidates, including international applicants, who sought the $93,226 position after it was vacated by Louis Levine. Levine resigned in June to become director of collections and exhibitions at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City.  </p>
<p>"The New York State Museum is the oldest state museum in the nation and has made important contributions to the advancement of knowledge about New York and the world," Dr. Siegfried said. "I consider it an honor to be asked to lead the New York State Museum."</p>
<p>In his new role, Dr. Siegfried will oversee the Museum's master plan to revamp its permanent exhibitions; continue developing partnerships with other museums to bring world-class exhibits to Albany, such as the Fleet Great Art Exhibition and Education Program; and to advocate on behalf of museums throughout the state.</p>
<p>"We need to have more of a statewide presence so we can provide school children everywhere with exciting opportunities, such as distance learning," Dr. Siegfried said. "And since we're committed to lifelong learning for all New Yorkers, we hope to better enrich the experience of every one of our visitors."</p>
<p>Dr. Siegfried is also involved in an effort to procure additional funding to improve the stewardship of the Museum's 6 million items in its collections. That will keep the Museum's resources accessible to future generations of New Yorkers.</p>
<p>An environmental biologist specializing in the study of freshwater ecology, Dr. Siegfried has worked at the Museum for 20 years. He received a Ph.D. from the University of California at Davis. Since 1995, he has worked as the Deputy Director for the Museum. Prior to that, he was the chief of the biological survey. A prolific researcher, he has continued to publish articles, including two in 1998 focusing on the impact zebra mussels have on the quality of waterways in central New York. His important studies investigating the effect of zebra mussels has helped monitor the growing threat of the invasive pest to New York State.  </p>
