<title>STATE MUSEUM INTENT ON PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES </title>

<p>ALBANY, NY --- The New York State Museum has  received a $1 million federal grant to conduct a new research project aimed at protecting  endangered species of native freshwater mussels from the lethal fouling impacts  of invasive zebra mussels. </p>
<p>  With the grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  through its Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, Museum scientists will use  their environmentally safe invention &ndash; a biopesticide &ndash; to continue their  research with a new emphasis on open water applications. The project will be led by Museum research  scientists Daniel Molloy and Denise Mayer. </p>
<p>  The Museum will collaborate with two federal institutions along the  Mississippi River &ndash; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&rsquo;s Genoa National Fish  Hatchery and the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s Upper Midwest Environmental Services  Center &ndash; to develop protocols to protect native freshwater mussels, many of  which have been listed as threatened or endangered species, often due to the lethal  impacts caused by zebra mussels covering their shells.</p>
<p>  The EPA grant will allow Museum scientists to pursue a new aspect of the  use of this biopesticide by exploring its effectiveness in lakes and rivers as  a way to protect native freshwater mussels from the lethal fouling of zebra mussels  and their close relatives, quagga mussels. They will further examine the impact  of the biopesticide product formulations on the species of fish and native  mussels that could be present in a river or lake when the product is applied to  open waters. This environmental safety  information will allow fishery and native mussel conservationists to select the  most appropriate treatment regimes for their needs to help reduce the impacts of  zebra mussels.</p>
<p>  &ldquo;This is an exciting research  opportunity since we&rsquo;ll be developing real protocols using a technology that  was invented here at the Museum to help protect native freshwater mussels --  some of the most imperiled aquatic animals in North America,&rdquo; said Mayer, the  scientist who will manage the project.</p>
<p>  Mayer and Molloy&rsquo;s prior research focused on finding a remedy for the  clogging of pipe systems by zebra mussels and quagga mussels in industrial  systems, such as power plants that use water for energy production or cooling. This results in billions of dollars in  economic damage due to lost production and costs for remediation. The chemical treatment of these industrial  pipe systems to reduce these mussel infestations risks polluting lakes and  rivers. Scientists at the Museum&rsquo;s Field  Research Laboratory in Cambridge,  led by Dr. Molloy, sought to discover an environmentally safe control method, and  screened over 700 bacteria before identifying a strain of the common bacterium<em> Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> as being lethal  to these mussels when ingested.</p>
<p>  Museum scientists also discovered that dead cells of this strain were  equally as lethal as live cells, providing clear evidence that the mussels died  from a natural toxin in the cells, not from infection. This is very significant because it means that  future commercial formulations will contain dead cells, thus further reducing  environmental concerns. Testing at the Cambridge laboratory also  revealed the extraordinary selectivity of the bacteria in killing zebra and  quagga mussels without killing other aquatic organisms, including fish and  other species of freshwater clams and mussels.  Marrone Bio Innovations of Davis, CA is expected to make the <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> product  commercially available in 2011 following biopesticide registration by the EPA.</p>
<p>  Founded in 1836, the New York State  Museum in Albany is a cultural program of the New York  State Education Department&rsquo;s Office of Cultural Education. It has the longest continuously operating  state natural history research and collection survey in the U.S. Further information can be obtained by calling (518) 474-5877  or visiting the museum website at <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">www.nysm.nysed.gov</a>. </p>
